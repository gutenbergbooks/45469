<p class="drop-capi"><i><span class="smcap">BEFORE</span> deciding to issue this translation
I had first to reflect whether my Florentine
studies could be of any use to the
English public. Since Roscoe's day
English literature has been enriched by
works of much importance on different
phases of the political, literary, and artistic history of
Florence. Both Napier and Trollope have bequeathed
very complete narratives of Florentine events, and translations
of notable foreign works have also been produced.
But nearly all these works appeared before any scientific
research as to the origin of the City and Commonwealth
had begun, or, at least, before it had reached the results
I have briefly expounded, and which deserve notice, not
only on the score of intrinsic worth, but also because they
throw new light on the subsequent history of Florence.</i></p>

<p><i>To attempt any new delineation of the special vicissitudes
of the Florentine Republic, already so exhaustively
and lucidly treated by other historians, would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
outside my purpose. As stated in the preface to the Italian
edition, my sole aim was to investigate in what manner the
Republic was formed, the nature of its constitution, the
why and wherefore of its continual transmutations, the
first causes and genuine motives of the factions by which
the city was torn, and likewise to ascertain how it came
about that&mdash;despite all this turbulence and strife&mdash;commerce
and industry, the fine arts and letters should have
been able to achieve such marvellous results. Now, so far
as I know, English literature contains nothing on this
particular theme, although one that can scarcely fail to be
of some use and interest even to readers familiar with
greater works and more extended and detailed accounts of
Florentine history.</i></p>

<p><i>These researches are not pursued beyond the times of Dante
and Henry VII., inasmuch as that term actually marks
the close of the period during which the Republic took shape
and built up its constitution. This was followed by a new
phase of equally high importance but very different character,
during which the Republic entered, instead, on a
course of decomposition. In fact, we have only to draw a
comparison between the "Divine Comedy" and the "Decameron,"
to instantly perceive how deep was the change a
few years had wrought in the spirit of Florence and of all
Italy. These two works were almost contemporaneous, yet
when reading them they seem to us the product of two entirely
different ages. Whether in politics, religion, morals, or
letters, the character of these two periods is seen to be essentially
diverse. The Middle Ages, with all their rough
primitive originality, have come to an end; classic learning
and the Renaissance have begun. Touching this second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
period, there is no scarcity of information, documents, or
chroniclers, as in the case of the first. The historian is
confronted by totally novel problems to which numerous
modern writers have given their attention, and which have
also been investigated in previous works of my own.</i></p>

<p><i>Even this second period would certainly afford matter
for another work on the gradual course of political and
moral dissolution, during which art and literature blossomed
to new splendour. Such investigations, however, would
transport me beyond the limits I have set to this book.
Under what conditions and amid what difficulties these
researches were begun and carried forward has been
already plainly told in my preface to the Italian edition.
It only remains for me to crave the indulgence of English
readers.</i></p>

<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</a></h2>

<div><img src="images/i_a.jpg" class="drop-capi" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-capi2"><span class="smcap"><span class="drop-capi2a">A</span> WORD</span> of explanation is due to my
readers touching the genesis of the
present work.</p>

<p>In 1866 I began a course of lectures
at our Istituto Superiore on the
History of Florence, chiefly for the
purpose of examining the political constitution of the
Republic, and investigating the various transformations
it had undergone during the long series of internal
revolutions by which the city was harassed. In this
way I hoped to ascertain the veritable causes of those
revolutions, to discover some leading thread through the
mazes of Florentine history, which even when treated
by great writers has often been found exceedingly involved
and obscure, and likewise to determine the most
logical mode of arranging it in periods. Even a partial
solution of these problems would have been of some use.
I continued the lectures for a considerable time, but suspended
them on reaching the period of Giano della Bella's
"Decrees of Justice" (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Ordinamenti di Giustizia</span></i>), 1293.
Some of these discourses were published in the Milan
<i>Politecnico</i>, others in the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Nuova Antologia</span></i> at Florence.
It was then my intention to collect them in a volume;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
but after some hesitation I renounced the idea. It seemed
indispensable to at least add some outline of the course
of events subsequent to the fall of Giano della Bella and
the exile of Dante, in order to conclude the first and most
important period of the political history of Florence.
Besides, I saw that the necessity of continuing these
lectures on fixed days had not always allowed sufficient
time for overcoming obstacles encountered by the way.
Accordingly, more than a superficial revisal was required;
gaps had to be filled in, certain pages re-written. Hence
fresh researches were demanded, for which other labours
granted no leisure at the moment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile new documents, new dissertations, and
monographs on Florentine history were continually
appearing, besides notable works on a larger scale such
as those of Capponi, Del Lungo, Hartwig, Perrens, &amp;c.
All this increased the difficulty of revising and correcting
lectures, now lapsing inevitably more and more out of
date. On the other hand I sometimes found previous
deductions confirmed by recently discovered documents,
and that certain general ideas I had enounced were
accepted and followed by writers of note. This naturally
inclined me to be less severe in judging my work, and
more disposed to listen to the tried friends who were
urging its republication.</p>

<p>Being thus encouraged to resume my forsaken studies,
I lectured in 1888 on the times of Henry VII. of
Germany and the exile of Dante. Later on, in 1890,
recognising that my previous work on the origins of the
city and its commonwealth had become altogether inadequate
since the appearance of so much new material,
I returned to the subject in a fresh course of lectures,
which likewise saw the light in the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Nuova Antologia</span></i>.
Then, I finally began to put the scattered papers together
to revise and correct them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
Hence it will be plainly seen that this book is composed
of various separate parts which, although informed, one
and all, by the same leading idea and treating of the
same argument, were produced at distant intervals during
a quarter of a century, in which the study of Florentine
history had made rapid advance through the labours of
numerous and competent writers. Therefore, in spite of
devoting my best efforts to pruning, revising, and arranging
my lectures, they are still old essays more or less
disjointed, and containing many unavoidable repetitions.
Greater organic unity could only have been attained by
re-writing the whole and composing a new book; whereas
my intention was merely to republish a series of scattered
compositions, under the fitting title of "Researches."</p>

<p>What finally decided me to reprint them was, that,
as I venture to think, their dominant and fundamental
notes still ring true, even after the numerous works
produced by other hands. Indeed, unless I be mistaken,
those works frequently support my observations, and
confirm the ideas expressed throughout on the general
character and progressive development of Florentine
history. Whether I be right or wrong in this belief the
reader must decide. At any rate I venture to hope
that, in judging this book, he will kindly make allowance
for the time and manner in which it came into existence.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div><img src="images/i_t.jpg" class="drop-capi" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">THE</span> history of Italian freedom, from
the Middle Ages to the new series
of foreign invasions, dating from
the descent of Charles VIII. in 1494,
mainly consists of the history of our
communes. But this history is as yet
unwritten, and, worse still, can never be written until the
material required for the task shall have been brought to
light, sifted, and illustrated. What were the most ancient
political statutes, what those of the guilds of art and
commerce, what the penal and civil laws, the individual
conditions, revenue, expenditure, trade, and industry of
those republics? To all these questions we can give but
imperfect replies at the best, and some are left altogether
unsolved. Yet until all are decided the civil history of
our communes remains involved in obscurity.</p>

<p>Through Machiavelli and Giannone Italy gave the
world the first essays in constitutional history, and by
Muratori's gigantic labours inaugurated the great school
of learning that is the only settled basis of modern and,
more especially, of constitutional history. But we soon
allowed the sceptre we had won to be snatched from our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
grasp. It is true that we have never experienced any
dearth of great scholars or historians, but the complete
national history of a people is a task exceeding the powers
of one or of several individuals. Such history must be
produced, as it were, by the nation itself. Only the combined
efforts of many scholars and of many generations
can succeed in co-ordinating and investigating the vast
mass of material that has to be ransacked in order to trace
through the vicissitudes of numerous municipalities, all
differing from, and at war with one another, the history
of the Italian people. It has been long the custom with
us for every one to work independently: hence we lack
the spirit of agreement and co-operation required to enable
individual efforts to carry forward the work of the whole
country at the same pace. Certainly, however, I must not
forget to note the example of our various national historical
societies, subsidised by the Government, and composed
of most learned and deserving men. But these associations
and commissions have as yet no general nor united
plan of work; and, in fact, some of their members are
apt to devote their energies to labours which, however
important, are disconnected from the main object. Thus
there will be much delay before our learned men complete
the investigation of any one period of our history. Yet
the rules which should be followed are not far to seek,
since Italians were the first to discover them, and we still
bear them in mind. Nor has the issue of highly important
collections of documents been relegated exclusively to our
societies and commissions. None can have forgotten the
untiring labours of the worthy Vieusseux and his friends
in their management of the "Archivio Storico Italiano"!
To show what excellent results may be achieved by the
publication of a single series of State papers, it is sufficient
to mention the Despatches (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Relazioni</span></i>) of Venetian Ambassadors,
given to the world by Alberi, and whereby not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
only Italian but European history has been so greatly
profited. What progress might not be made would all
Italian scholars consent to devote their labours to a
common end! We have seen how much Professor Pertz
was enabled to achieve at Berlin, with a subsidy from the
Confederation, and aided by all the scholars of Germany.
Truly, his "Monumenta" form an enduring memorial of
the national history of the Fatherland, and has become
the nucleus of a new school of scholars and historians.</p>

<p>Now that Italy is united, and her many states fused
into one, she should know the history of her communes,
and trace out the history of her people. It should also be
kept in view that the Commune was the institution by
whose means modern society was evolved from the Middle
Ages. Rising in the midst of a throng of slaves, vassals,
barons, marquises, dukes, the Commune gave birth to the
<i>third estate</i> and the people which, after first destroying
feudalism in Italy, subsequently by the French Revolution,
destroyed it throughout Europe. Even Augustin
Thierry notes that "thus was formed the immense congregation
of free men who in 1789 undertook for all France
that which had been achieved by their forefathers in
mediæval <span class="locked">municipalities."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> Accordingly, since Italy was
the centre and seat of municipal liberty, the purpose of the
present work is not only to investigate our civil history,
but to demonstrate how much we contributed to the discovery
of the principles of modern society and civilisation.
All careful students of the history of Roman law in the
Middle Ages will have occasion to remark that our commentators
while reviewing ancient jurisprudence, unconsciously
modified it in adapting it to their own times.
Francesco Forti has declared that no student of our statutes
can fail to perceive that many of the regulations found in
the Napoleon Code, and supposed to be created by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
French Revolution, already formed part of the old Italian
law. I have come to the conclusion that in every branch
of Italian civil life our history will be able to prove that
the same remark holds good, inasmuch as our civil institutions
contained the primary germs of modern freedom.
But no one has yet dared to attempt this task, and, as I
said before, no single strength could suffice for it. We
have now to deal with a far humbler theme. By tracing
in bold outline the history of a single commune, we desire
to show what fresh researches remain to be made, and how
many problems to be solved.</p>

<p>The vicissitudes of the Florentine Republic can only be
paralleled with those of the most flourishing periods of
Athenian freedom. Throughout modern history we might
seek in vain the example of another city simultaneously so
turbulent and prosperous, where, despite so much internecine
carnage, fine arts, letters, commerce, and industry, all
flourished equally. The historian almost doubts his own
veracity when bound to recount how a handful of men
settled on a small spot of earth, extended their trade to
the East and the West; establishing banks throughout
Europe; and accumulated such vast wealth, that private
fortunes sometimes sufficed to support tottering thrones.
He has also to relate how these rich merchants founded
modern poetry with their Dante, painting with their
Giotto; how with the aid of their Arnolfo and Brunellesco,
and of their Michelangelo, who was poet, painter,
sculptor, and architect in one, they raised the stupendous
buildings which the world will lastingly admire. The
first and subtlest of European diplomatists were Florentines;
political science and civil history were born in
Florence with Machiavelli. Towards the end of the
Middle Ages this narrow township seems a small point of
fire shedding light over the whole world.</p>

<p>It might well be thought that all difficulties regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
the history of this commune must have been already
overcome, seeing that the finest Italian writers, the
greatest modern historians, have for so long made it the
theme of extended labours. In fact, what other city can
boast annals penned by such men as Villani, Compagni,
Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Nardi, Varchi? And, in addition
to histories and chronicles, we find an endless string
of Diaries, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Prioristi</span></i> (Notebooks), Reminiscences, before
coming down to modern writers. Among the Florentines
it was a very common practice to keep a daily register of
events, and in this wise their splendid store of historic
literature was continually enlarged. But, nevertheless, no
history bristles with so many difficulties as that of Florence,
nor offers so many apparently insurmountable contradictions.
Events pass before our eyes, well described, vividly
coloured; they flit past in a rapid and uninterrupted
whirl, never resting, subject to no law, and seemingly
obedient to chance alone. Personal hatred, jealousy, and
private revenge produce political revolutions, drenching
the city with the blood of its children. These revolutions
endure for months, perhaps even for years, and end with
arbitrary decrees, which are violated or undone the moment
they have received magisterial sanction. Thus we are
often moved to inquire, How can this be the work of far-seeing
diplomats, of great politicians? Either lofty
commendations for political good sense and acuteness
were falsely lavished on men incapable of giving their
country sound laws and stable institutions, and who in
the gravest affairs of State were solely influenced by personal
loves and hates; or else for centuries past we have
accorded unmerited praise to the historians who have
described impossible events to us in the most vivid
colours. In fact, how could it possibly be that so much
good sense should breed so much disorder? How, too,
in the midst of this disorder, with the vessel of the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
at the mercy of every wind that blew, could art, science,
and literature give forth so glorious a harvest?</p>

<p>Undoubtedly history, as we interpret it to-day, was
unknown to the ancients. We seek the causes of events,
whereas they merely described them. We wish to know
the laws, manners, ideas, and prejudices of mankind,
whereas our forefathers were exclusively concerned with
human passions and actions. In the fifteenth century
political science was chiefly a study of human nature,
while at this day it is mainly a study of institutions.
Modern history aims at the examination of mankind and
society in every form, and from every point of view.
That is why we have had to so often re-fashion the work
that, nevertheless, had been splendidly performed by
writers of old.</p>

<p>Leaving aside all compilers of those fables and legends
on the origin of Florence found repeated in even later
works, Florentine historians may be divided into two
great schools. First come the authors of Chronicles or
Diaries, who flourished chiefly in the fourteenth century,
although they continued long after that period. These
writers record day by day the events they have witnessed
and in which they have often taken part; stirred
by the very passions they describe, they sometimes rise
to eloquence, and the heat of their own words leaves them
no time to dwell on abstract ideas. They presuppose in
their readers their own detailed knowledge of the political
institutions among which their lives were spent, but which
are unknown to us, and the object of our keenest desire.
Frequently, however, some fourteenth-century chronicler,
such as Giovanni Villani, with his incomparable gift of
observation, supplies such minute descriptions of events,
reports so many details, that, almost unawares, we find
ourselves carried back to his day. Sometimes, when
descending to particulars, he apologises for detaining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
reader on topics of small moment, little foreseeing what
value we later generations would attach to all those
details of the trade, instruction, revenue, and expenditure
of the Republic, or how we should long for more
facts of the same kind. But as soon as these writers
touch upon times and events outside their own experience,
they have either to copy verbatim from other chroniclers,
or their narratives remain cold, colourless, and devoid of
merit or authority. We pass at once from the most
lively and graphic descriptions to the strangest fables, the
greatest incoherence, since these men are incapable of
using any discernment even in copying literally from
others. Proofs of this are seen in their puerile accounts
of the foundation of Florence. Historical criticism was
as yet unborn.</p>

<p>The scholarship of the fifteenth century gave rise to
the study and imitation of Sallust and Livy; and Italian
writers were no longer content to register facts from day
to day, unconnectedly and without order. Many wrote
in Latin, others in Italian; but all sought to compose
historical narratives in a more artistic, or at all events,
more artificial way. They launched into exordiums
and general considerations; gave lengthy descriptions,
eked out by many flights of fancy, of wars they
had never witnessed, and of which they knew little
or nothing; they attributed imaginary speeches to their
personages, and sometimes fashioned their narratives
in the shape of dialogues, to increase the distance
between themselves and their fourteenth-century <span class="locked">predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span></p>

<p>It was a period of rhetorical essays and servile imitations
of the classics, during which Italian history and
literature declined, although preparing for revival in the
coming age. In fact, we find the art of history notably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
advanced in the sixteenth century. Machiavelli, who may
be styled the most illustrious founder of that art, begins
with a word of blame to preceding historians exactly
because "they had said little or nothing of civil discords,
or of existing internal enmities and their effects, and
described other matters with a brevity that could be
neither useful nor pleasing to the reader." Indirectly,
these words serve as a faithful portrait of the book that
has proved the most lasting monument to his own fame.
He inquires into the causes of events, the origin of all
the parties and revolutions of the Republic; thus
creating a new method and opening a new road. He
reduces the whole history of the Commonwealth into an
admirable unity; he rejects with profound contempt
the fabulous tales bequeathed by the chronicler regarding
the foundation of Florence, and throws an eagle glance
on party manœuvres from their origin down to his own
day. He was the first to undertake these researches, and,
notwithstanding all newer investigations, his fundamental
idea maintains its value.</p>

<p>But Machiavelli gave little heed to institutions, scarcely
any at all to laws and customs. Furthermore, he was so
entirely guided by his instinct of divination as to care
little for the historic exactitude of particular facts. To
ascertain the infinite number of inaccuracies and blunders
contained in his book, and which would be unpardonable
in a modern writer, his narrative must be compared with
the contemporary accounts of the old chroniclers, some of
which were known to him. Not only are there frequent
errors of date, but also of the names and number of
magistrates and of the framework of institutions. It
would seem that while divining the spirit of events, he
simultaneously remoulded them according to his own
fancy. Sometimes we find him appropriating entire pages
from Cavalcanti's history, even transcribing the fictitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
speeches attributed by that chronicler to historic characters,
and by a few touches of his own pouring new life into
the dull narrative without troubling to undertake any
fresh research. Thus, his book, although a valuable guide,
is also an unsafe one. He cannot always abstain from
transplanting a true fact to the place best suited to his
own theories, thus filling up inconvenient gaps without
many scruples of conscience. His aim, so he tells us,
was to investigate the causes of parties and revolutions.
What is now designated as local colour&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the historic
colour of facts&mdash;is entirely absent from his narrative, and
particularly from that of the earlier days of the Republic.
Men adhere to different factions, sometimes commit evil,
sometimes generous deeds, but are apparently always the
same in his eyes. To what extent the clear appreciation
of events is hampered by this theory may easily be
imagined. Then, too, as Machiavelli draws nearer to his
own times, he sees the constitution of the Republic
changing and decaying, freedom disappearing, and a
thousand personal passions arising to hasten the overthrow
of enfeebled institutions. A knowledge of minute
particulars would be doubly desirable at this period to
make us understand the social revolution in question; but
Machiavelli, though always a fifteenth-century Florentine,
never lost sight of the example of Titus Livy and other
Roman writers, and consequently, like all the scholars of
his age, was inspired with a lofty contempt for any small
details apt to endanger the epic unity of historic narrative.
Then, later on, in approaching the distinct domination of
the Medici, under whose rule he was living, he turns aside
with ill-concealed disgust from the internal vicissitudes of
the Republic and gives his whole attention to external
events. He then discourses of warfare and of the Italian
policy that was the passion of his life. In the midst of
court intrigues and the contested predominance of this or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
that party, we find him chiefly concerned in ascertaining
how a new prince might best reunite the scattered
members of his torn and oppressed motherland; and note
that this noble design frequently makes him forget the
history of Florence.</p>

<p>In reading old chronicles of contemporary events, we
see before our eyes the living, speaking figures of Giano
della Bella, Farinata degli Uberti, Corso Donati, and
Michele di Lando. Their feelings, loves, and hates are
known and almost familiar to us; but we are plunged in
a restless, unrestrained tumult of passions, without knowing
whence blows the blast driving men and things onward
in a whirl of confusion, without one moment's truce.
No sooner do we pass beyond the visual horizon of the
writer, than all images become confused, and our sight is
no less obscured than his own. Even at moments of
most eloquent description we hear of institutions and
magistrates conveying no meaning to our ears, and often
see these change, disappear, and return without grasping
the why and wherefore. But when, on the other hand,
by the study and imitation of ancient authors, the art
of embracing a vaster circle of facts springs into being,
and the causes and relations of those facts are investigated
in order to weld them into visible unity, historic criticism
is still lacking to verify events, to examine and define
laws and institutions, to colour and almost revive the past
in all its varied and changeful aspects. The genius of the
historian emits, as it were, flashes of light; but these,
while illuminating some occasional point, only leave a
confused and uncertain view of past ages in our mind.
We require to know men and institutions, parties and
laws, as they really were; nor is this enough: we must
also comprehend how all these elements were fused into
unity, and how laws and institutions were begotten by
those men in those times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
This was the task modern writers should have performed,
but many reasons have prevented its completion.
First of all, the progress achieved by art and literature
while liberty was perishing in Florence, and their great
influence on all modern culture, fixed the principal attention
of writers on this section of Florentine history as being
one of very general importance, and more easily intelligible
to all. Accordingly, the greater number of modern,
and especially of foreign students neither examined nor
understood the precise period in which all the noblest
qualities of the Florentine nature had been formed, and
during which were evolved and trained the intellectual
powers afterwards expressed in art and letters to the
admiration of the whole world. Many foreigners seemed
to believe that art and letters had not only flourished
when manners were most corrupt, but were almost the
result of and identified with the corruption that led to
their decline. For the fine arts, being the offspring of
liberty and morality, could not long survive their parent
forces.</p>

<p>It should be also observed that no great modern
writer has yet produced any work specially devoted to
the political and constitutional history of <span class="locked">Florence.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> It
must be confessed that more than by any modern pen
was achieved to this effect by the elder and younger
Ammirato, who, although writers of the seventeenth
century, already began to ransack State papers, and composed
a work that was new and remarkable at that
period. But they neither proposed to write a history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
of the Florentine constitution, nor possessed sufficient
critical equipment for the purpose, had they sought to
fulfil it. They often overload new and valuable information
regarding events, and even institutions, with a
mass of useless detail, destructive to the general unity of
their narrative.</p>

<p>It is scarcely requisite to add that modern writers, only
treating of Florence in general histories of Italy, were
necessarily compelled to pass briefly over secondary parts
of their work. They often relied too blindly on old
authors of acknowledged repute and influence, without
using enough discrimination in sifting material of undeniable
value from other parts composed of second-hand
narratives and repetitions of fabulous tales. We
have only to compare Villani with Malespini to see that
one of the two undoubtedly copied many chapters from
the <span class="locked">other.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> Nor is this a solitary example. As we have
before remarked, Machiavelli borrowed whole chapters
from <span class="locked">Cavalcanti;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> Guicciardini often translated from
Galeazzo Capra, better known under the name of
<span class="locked">Capella;<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> Nardi reproduced Buonaccorsi verbatim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Therefore, without critical examination of these writers,
and careful decision as to their relative value and the
confidence to be accorded to different parts of their
works, it is uncommonly easy to be misled. For this, and
many other reasons, modern historians of Italy encounter
numerous pitfalls when treating of Florentine matters.
Now and then we see them halting, in common with
chroniclers of the widest renown, to define the precise
functions of the Captain of the people, or Podestà,
or Council of the Commune, and afterwards finding it
extremely difficult to make their definitions agree with
actual facts whenever those titles recur in their pages.
Such mistakes nearly always proceed from a double
source. The definitions supplied by old writers regarding
magistrates and their functions were extremely slight,
when they alluded to their own times, and often inexact
where other periods were in question. Also, modern
writers generally demand a precise and fixed definition of
institutions which were subject to change from the day
of their birth, and unalterable only in name. The name
not only remains intact after the institution has become
entirely different from what it was at first, but often long
outlives the institution itself. It is curious to see what
ingenious theories are then started to give substance
and reality to names now become ghosts of a vanished
past. The only way to thread this labyrinth is by
endeavouring to reconstruct the series of radical changes
every one of those institutions underwent, and without
once losing sight of the mutual relations preserved between
them during the continual vicissitudes to which they are
subject. Only by seeking the law that regulates and
dominates these changes is it possible to discern the
general idea of the Republic and determine the value of
its institutions.</p>

<p>But what can be done while we lack so many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
elements most needed for the completion of this task?
The learned have yet to arrange, examine, and illustrate
the endless series of provisions, statutes, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">consulte</span></i>,
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">pratiche</span></i>, ambassadorial reports, and, in short, of all the
State papers of the Republic, many of which are still
unsought and undiscovered. Nevertheless, we believe
that, without attempting for the present any complete
history of Florence, some rather useful work may be
performed. We may certainly follow the guidance of
old chroniclers and historians regarding events of which
they had ocular testimony, trying, when needed, to temper
their party spirit by confronting them with writers of an
opposite faction. Vast numbers of documents have been
published in driblets, and many learned dissertations,
although the series is still incomplete; besides, one may
easily resort to the Florence archives in order to vanquish
difficulties and bridge the principal gaps. And after
undertaking researches of this kind, it seems easy to us to
clearly prove how the whole history of Florence may be
illumined by a new light, and its apparent disorder made
to disappear. In fact, as soon as one begins to carefully
examine the veritable first causes underlying the apparent,
and often, fallacious causes of political revolutions in
Florence, these revolutions will be found to follow one
another in a marvellously logical sequence. Then in the
wildest chaos we seem rapidly able to discern a mathematical
succession and connection of causes and effects.
Personal hatreds and jealousies are not causes, but only
opportunities serving to accelerate the fast and feverish
sequence of reforms by which the Florentine Commune,
after trying by turns every political constitution possible
at the time, gradually attained to the highest liberty compatible
with the Middle Ages. It is this noble aim, this
largeness of freedom, that rouses all the intellectual and
moral force contained in the Republic, evolves its admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
political acumen, and allows letters and art and
science to put forth such splendid flowers in the midst of
apparent disorder. But when strictly personal passions
and hatreds prevail, then real chaos begins, the constitution
becomes corrupt, and the downfall of freedom is at
hand.</p>

<p>The sole aim of the present work is to offer a brief
sketch of the history of Florence during the foundation
of its liberties. So great is the importance of the theme
that the historian Thiers has given long attention to it,
and we know that an illustrious Italian has already made
it the object of many years of strenuous <span class="locked">research.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The history of every Italian republic may be divided
into two chief periods: the origin of the commune, the
development of its constitution and its liberties. In the
first period, during which an old state of society is decaying
and a new one arising, it is hard to distinguish the history
of any one commune from that of the rest, inasmuch as
it treats of Goths, Longobards, Greeks, and Franks, who
dominate the greater part of Italy in turn, reducing the
country, almost throughout its extent, to identical conditions.
The position of conquerors and of conquered is
everywhere the same, only altered by change of rulers.
Amid the obscurity of the times and scarcity of information,
there seems scarcely any difference between one
Italian city and another. But differences are more
clearly defined, and become increasingly prominent after
the first arisal of freedom. Most obscure, though not of
earliest date, was perhaps the origin of Florence, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
tarried long before beginning to rise to importance. Our
present purpose being merely to throw light on the history
of the Florentine Constitution, we need not devote many
words to the first period mentioned above&mdash;namely, of the
origin of Italian communes in general. At one time
this question was the theme of a learned, lengthy, and
most lively dispute, chiefly carried on by Italian and
German writers. But the scientific severity of researches,
in which Italian scholars won much honour, was often
impaired by patriotism and national prejudice. It
being recognised that the origin of the Commune was
likewise the origin of modern liberty and society, the
problem was tacitly transformed into another question&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
whether Italians or Germans were the first founders
of these liberties, this society? It is easy to understand
how political feelings were then imported into the controversy,
and effectually removed it from the ground of
tranquil debate.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the last century the question was
often discussed in Italy by learned men of different views,
such as Giannone, Maffei, Sigonio, Pagnoncelli, &amp;c.
Muratori, though lacking any prearranged system, threw
powerful flashes of light on the subject, and raised it to
higher regions by force of his stupendous learning. But
the dispute did not become heated until Savigny took up
the theme in his renowned "History of Roman Law in
the Middle Ages." In endeavouring to prove the uninterrupted
continuity of the said jurisprudence, he was obliged&mdash;inasmuch
as all historical events are more or less connected
together&mdash;to maintain that the Italians, when subject
to barbarian and even to Longobard rule, lost neither all
their personal liberty nor their ancient rights, and that
the Roman Commune was never completely destroyed.
Accordingly, the revival of our republics and of Roman
law was no more than a renewal of old institutions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
laws which had never entirely disappeared. Germany
was quick to see to what conclusions the ideas of our
great historian tended, and thereupon Eichorn, Leo,
Bethmann, Karl Hegel, and others, rose up in arms
against the theory of the Italian Commune being of
Roman birth. They maintained, on the contrary, that
the barbarians, and more especially the Longobards,
whose domination was harsher and more prolonged than
the rest, had stripped us of all liberty, destroyed every
vestige of Roman institutions, and that, consequently, the
new communes and their statutes were of new creation,
and originally derived from Germanic tribes alone.</p>

<p>To all appearance these views should have stirred
Italian patriotism to furious opposition, and made
Savigny's ideas universally popular among us. Yet this
was not the case. We supplied many learned adherents
to either side. At that time our national feeling had just
awakened; we already desired&mdash;nay, claimed&mdash;a united
Italy, no matter at what cost, and detested everything that
seemed opposed to our unity. Well, the Longobards
had been on the point of mastering the whole of Italy, and
the Papacy alone had been able to arrest their conquests by
securing the aid of the Franks. But for this, even the
Italy of the ninth or tenth century might have become
as united a country as France. Already the school of
thinkers had been revived among us that, even in Machiavelli's
day, had regarded the Pope as the fatal cause of
Italy's divisions. Therefore, naturally enough, while confuting
Savigny's views, our nineteenth-century Ghibellines
exalted the Longobards, ventured to praise their
goodness and humanity, and hurled invectives against the
Papacy for having prevented their general and permanent
conquest of Italy. But, on the other hand, there was also
a political school that looked to the Pope as the future
saviour of Italy, and this school, prevailing later on during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the revolution of 1848, adopted the opposite theory, and
possessed two most illustrious representatives in Manzoni
and Carlo Troya. At any rate, they had little difficulty
in proving that barbarians had been invariably barbaric,
killing, destroying, and trampling down all things, and
that the Papacy, by summoning the Franks, no matter
for what end, had certainly rendered some help to the
harshly oppressed masses. The Franks, in fact, gave
some relief to the Latin population, sanctioned the use
of Roman law and granted new powers to Popes and
bishops, who undoubtedly contributed to the revival
of the communes. Thus, although for opposite ends,
identical opinions were maintained on both sides of
the Alps. Throughout this controversy learning was
always subordinated to political aims, although the disputants
may not have been always aware of it; and
historic truth and serenity consequently suffered unavoidable
hurt. Balbo, Capponi, and Capei, after throwing
their weight on this side or that, ended by holding very
temperate views, and their teachings cast much light on
the point at issue.</p>

<p>The main difficulty proceeds from the fact that few
persons are willing to believe that in the Middle Ages, as
well as throughout modern history, we can always trace
the continuous reciprocal action of the Latin and German
races, and that it is impossible to award the merit of any
of the chief political, social, or literary revolutions exclusively
to either. On the contrary, wherever the absolute
predominance of one of the two races seems most
undoubted, we have to tread with most caution, and seek
to discover what share of the work was due to the other.
Likewise, in order to justly weigh and determine their
reciprocal rights in history, impartial narrative would have
a better chance of success than any system based on
political ideas. Assuredly, when facts are once thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
verified, no system is needed, since general ideas result
naturally from facts. Were it allowable to introduce here a
comparison with far younger times, we might remark that
when French literature invaded Germany in the eighteenth
century it obtained general imitation there, and unexpectedly
led to the revival of national German literature.
In order to glorify the national tone of this literature,
would it be necessary to maintain that the great previous
diffusion of French writings was only imagined by historians?
Later, the French flag was flaunted in nearly
every city of Germany, and the people humiliated and
crushed. From that moment we see the national German
spirit springing to vigorous life. Must we say that this
revival was due to the French? Is it not better to describe
events as they occurred, rejecting all foregone conclusions?
I am quite aware of the abyss between these
recent events and those of old days; but, nevertheless,
I consider that Balbo was right in remarking that
the fact of the origin of the communes being disputed
at such length and with so much heat and learning
by the two rival schools, proved that the truth was
not confined exclusively to either. Accordingly, we
will rapidly sum up the conclusions we deem the most
reasonable.</p>

<p>Every one knows that, after the earlier barbarian
descents, by which the Empire was devastated, and Rome
itself frequently ravaged, Italy endured five real and
thorough invasions. Odoacer, with his mercenary horde,
composed of men of different tribes, but generally designated
as Heruli, was the leader who dealt the mortal
blow in 476, and becoming master of Italy for more than
ten years, scarcely attempted to govern it, and only seized
a third of the soil. But a new host poured in from the
banks of the Danube, commonly styled Goths, and subdivided
into Visigoths and Ostrogoths. The former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
division, commanded by Alaric, had already besieged
and sacked Rome; the latter, led by Theodoric, appeared
in 489, and speedily subjected all Italy. Theodoric's
reign was highly praised. The chiefs of these early
barbarian tribes had often served for many years in
Roman legions, and had sometimes been educated in
Rome. Accordingly they felt a genuine admiration for the
majesty of the very empire that the heat of victory now
urged them to destroy. Theodoric organised the government;
and, according to the barbarian custom, seized
a third of the land for his men; but he left the Romans
their laws and their magistrates. In every province a
count was at the head of the government, and held
jurisdiction over the Ostrogoths. The Romans were
ruled according to their own laws, and these laws administered
by a mixed tribunal of both races. But Theodoric's
government became gradually harsher and more
intolerable to the Romans, so that, after his death, they
revolted against his successors, and invoked the aid of
the Greeks of the Eastern Empire. But revolt brought
them nothing save increased suffering, inasmuch as the
Goths began to murder the Romans in self-defence,
deprived them of what liberty and institutions they had
been allowed to retain, and organised a military and
absolute government. This was the government Belisarius
and Narses found established on coming from
Constantinople to deliver and reconquer Italy; this was
the government they copied with their dukes, or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">duces</span></i>.
The Ostrogoths had ruled Italy for fifty-nine years
(493&ndash;552), and the Greeks held it for sixteen more
(552&ndash;568). Theirs also was a purely martial government,
under the General-in-chief Narses, but with
dukes, tribunes, and inferior judges nominated by the
Empire. As usual, the newcomers appropriated a share
of the soil, and probably this share now went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
State. Their tyranny was different from that of the
barbarians, but it was the tyranny of corrupt rulers, and
therefore more cruel. The Greeks had expelled the Goths,
and next came the Longobards to drive out the Greeks.
They gradually extended their conquests, and in fifteen
years became masters of three-fourths of Italy, leaving only
a few strips of land, mainly near the sea, to the Greeks
whom they never succeeded in expelling altogether. The
Longobards struck deep roots in Italian soil, and dwelt
on it for more than two hundred years (568&ndash;773), ruling
in a very harsh and tyrannous fashion. They took a
third of the land, reduced the Italians almost to slavery,
and respected neither Roman laws nor Roman institutions.
Beneath their sway the ancient civilisation seemed annihilated,
and the germs of a newer one were prepared,
although its first budding forth is still involved in much
obscurity. Every controversy as to the origin of our
communes started from inquiries into the condition of
the Italians under the Longobard rule. If ancient tradition
were at any time really broken off and replaced by a
totally new one, it must have occurred under that rule.
Or, if it only underwent a great change before assuming
new life and vigour at a later time, the process must have
dated from the same period.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, wherever the Byzantine domination had
obtained, a feebler and more vacillating government weighed
less cruelly on the people; therefore, as early as the
seventh and eighth centuries, certain cities were seen to
develop new life. The Commune speedily took shape,
even in Rome, where the power of the Papacy, hostile to
the Longobards, had greatly increased. On first coming
among us, these barbarians of the Arian creed respected
neither the Catholic bishops, the minor clergy, nor anything
sacred or profane, and later on menaced the Eternal
City itself. Accordingly, as a means of defence against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
the threatening enemy at his gates, the Pontiff summoned
the Franks to save the Church and country from oppression.
They came in obedience to this call, led first
by Pepin and then by Charlemagne, who, driving out the
Longobards, and fortifying the Papacy by grants of land,
enabled the Pope to inaugurate his temporal dominion.
In reward for this Charlemagne was crowned emperor;
and thus the ancient Empire of the West was re-established
by the new Empire of the Franks, to which the Holy
Roman-Germanic Empire afterwards succeeded.</p>

<p>Thereupon the dissolution of barbarian institutions,
already begun in Italy, proceeded at a more rapid pace.
There was a ferment in Italian public life, heralding the
approach of a new era. Institutions, usages, laws,
traditions of all kinds&mdash;Longobard, Greek, Frankish,
ecclesiastical, Roman&mdash;were found side by side and jumbled
together. Next ensued a prolonged term of violence and
turmoil, during which the name of Italy was scarcely
heard. All old and new institutions seem at war, all
struggling in vain for supremacy, when suddenly the
Commune arises to solve the problem, and the era of
freedom begins. But what gave birth to the Commune?
This is the question by which we are always confronted.</p>

<p>It would be outside our present purpose to follow the
learned scholars who have sought to deduce ingenious and
complicated theories from some doubtful phrase in an old
codex, or the vague words of some chronicler. It is
certain that the Roman Empire was an aggregation of
municipalities exercising self-government. The city was
the primitive atom, the germ-cell, as it may be called, of
the great Roman society that began to disperse when the
capital lost the power of attraction required to bind
together so great a number of cities separated by vast
tracts of country either totally deserted, or only inhabited
by the slaves cultivating the soil. The barbarians, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
other hand, knew nothing of citizen life, and the <i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gau</span></i> or
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Comitatus</span></i> (whence the term <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> is derived), only comprising
embryo towns, or rather villages, which were sometimes
burnt when the tribes moved on elsewhere, resembled
the primitive nucleus of Teutonic society. In
the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitatus</span></i> the count ruled and administered justice
with his magistrates; the chiefs of the soldiery were
his subordinates, and became barons later on. Several
countships joined together formed the dukedoms or
marquisates into which Italy was then divided, and the
whole of the invading nation was commanded by a king
elected by the people.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the Germanic tribes held sway over
the Latin, the <i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gau</span></i> held sway over the cities which indeed
formed its constituents. And the counts, as military
chieftains, ruled the conquered land, of which the victors
appropriated one-third. The Goths pursued the same
plan; so too the Greeks, who replaced all counts by
their own <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">duces</span></i>; and so also the Longobards. Only
the latter's rule was far more tyrannous, especially at
first, and their history is very obscure. They began by
slaughtering the richest and most powerful Romans; they
seized one-third of the revenues, it would seem, instead of
the lands, thus leaving the oppressed masses without any
free property, and consequently in a worse condition than
before. The Goths had permitted the Romans to live in
their own way, but the Longobards respected no laws,
rights, nor institutions of the vanquished race. On this
head Manzoni <span class="locked">remarks<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> that no mention is found of any
Italian personage, whether actual or imaginary, in connection
with any royal office or public act of the time.
Nevertheless, from absolute tyranny, and even downright
subjection, to the total destroyal of every Roman law,
right, and institution, there is a long step. In order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
attribute to the Longobards&mdash;numbering, it is said, some
130,000 souls in all&mdash;the total extinction of Roman
life in every direction, we must credit them with an
administrative power, far too well ordered and disciplined,
too steadfast and permanent, to be any way
compatible with their condition. How could a tribe
incapable of comprehending Roman life persecute it to
extinction on all sides? Granting even, although this is
another disputed point, that the Romans were deprived
of all independent property; granting that Roman law
was neither legally recognised nor respected by the
Longobards, it by no means follows that every vestige
of Roman law and civilisation was therefore destroyed at
the time. Far more just and credible seems the opinion
of other writers who have maintained that when the
Longobards descended into Italy they thought chiefly of
their own needs, made no legal provision for the Italians,
and were satisfied with keeping them in <span class="locked">subjection.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>
Thus, in all private concerns, and in matters beyond the
grasp of the barbarian administration, the conquered
people could continue to live according to the Roman
law and in pursuance of ancient customs. In fact,
Romans and Longobards lived on Italian soil as two
separate nations; the fusion of victors and vanquished,
so easy elsewhere, is seen to have been difficult in Italy,
even after the lapse of two centuries. So great is the
tenacity and persistence of the Latin race among us, that
it is easier to reduce the conquered to slavery, or extirpate
them altogether, than to deprive them of their individuality.
In fact, whenever, by the force of things, and by
long intercourse, conquerors and conquered come into
closer contact, the barbarians are unavoidably driven to
make large concessions to the Latin civilisation, which
even when apparently extinguished is always found to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
life. How explain otherwise the gradual yielding of
Longobard law to the pressure of Roman law; how
explain the new species of code that gradually took shape,
and was styled by Capponi <i>an almost Roman edifice built
upon Germanic foundations</i>?</p>

<p>As the Longobards became more firmly established in
Italy, they began to inhabit the cities which they had
been unable to entirely destroy; they also began to
covet real property, and accordingly, during the reign
of their king Autari, instead of a third of the revenues,
seized an even larger proportion of the land. This
measure aggravated the condition of the vanquished on
the one hand, but greatly improved it on the other, by
leaving them in possession of some independent <span class="locked">property.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span>
And although, as Manzoni observed, we find no royal
officials, great or small, of Roman blood, it is no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
certain that the Longobards, having need of mariners,
builders, and artisans, were obliged to make use of
Romans and their superior skill in those capacities. It
was in this way that the ancient <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">scholae</span></i>, or associations
of craftsmen, continued to survive throughout the Middle
Ages, as we know to have been the case with the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">magistri
comacini</span></i>, or Guild of Como Masons, to whose skill the
conquering race had frequent recourse. In however
rough and disorderly a fashion these associations contrived
to withstand the barbarian impact, they were certainly an
element of the old civilisation, and kept the thread of it
unbroken. Other remains and traditions of that same
civilisation also clung about them; and when every other
form of government or protecting force was lacking to
the inhabitants of cities, these associations guarded the
public welfare to some extent. Do we not find that an
ancient municipality, when first left to its own resources,
sometimes closed the city gates against the barbarians, and
defended itself, almost after the manner of an independent
state? Was it not sometimes successful in repulsing
the foe? Even when conquered, trampled, and
crushed, can we suppose it to have been destroyed everywhere
alike, or so thoroughly cancelled from the memory
of the Latins, that, on seeing it reappear, we must
attribute its resurrection to Germanic tribes, to whom all
idea of a city was unknown until they had invaded our
soil? Did not the resuscitation of the Greek cities of
Southern Italy begin as far back as the seventh and eighth
centuries&mdash;namely, in the time of the Longobards&mdash;and
assuredly without the help of Germanic traditions? Did
not the Roman Commune arise at the same period? And
if the ancient municipalities, fallen beneath the Longobard
yoke, and therefore more cruelly oppressed, delayed
almost four centuries longer, did they not also follow the
example of their fellow-cities at last? What is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
meaning of the widely spread tradition, that only in that
paragon of independent, free republics, Byzantine Amalfi,
were preserved the Roman Pandects, which were then
captured by Pisa, and cherished as her most valued
treasure? Does not the whole subsequent history of
the Commune consist of the continual struggle of the
re-born Latin race against the descendants of Teuton
hordes? If Latin civilisation had been utterly destroyed,
how came it that the dead could rise again to combat the
living? Therefore, it seems clear to us that, although
the Longobards accorded no legal rights to the conquered
people, they could not practically deprive them of all;
they either tolerated or were unaware of many things,
and the tradition, usage, and persistence of the race kept
alive some remnants of Latin civilisation. Thus alone
can it be explained how, after enduring a harsh and long-continued
tyranny that apparently destroyed everything,
no sooner were a few links snapped off the strong,
barbaric chain, by which the Italian population was so
straitly bound, than Latin institutions sprang to new life,
and regained all the ground they had lost.</p>

<p>Barbarian society, both in form and tendency, was
essentially different from the Latin. Its predominant
characteristic was the so-called Germanic individualism,
as opposed to the Latin sociability. We note a prevalent
tendency to divide into distinct and separate groups. As
a body, it no sooner lost the force of cohesion and union
induced by the progress and rush of conquest, than it
immediately began to be scattered and disintegrated.
Owing to their nomadic and savage life, as well as to
the blood in their veins, the barbarians seemed to have
inherited an exaggerated personality and independence,
making it difficult for them to submit for long to a
common authority. Thus, when peace was established,
germs of enfeebling discord soon appeared among them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
In fact, when the Longobards had completed the conquest
of nearly the whole of Italy, they divided the land
into thirty-six Duchies, governed by independent dukes
enjoying absolute rule in their respective territories.
Under the dukes were sometimes counts, residing in
cities of secondary importance, and at the head of the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitati</span></i>; while still smaller cities were often ruled by a
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sculdascius</span></i>, or bailiff. Both dukes and bailies administered
justice according to the Longobard code, together with
the assistant judges, who, under the Franks, developed into
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">scabini</span></i>, or sheriffs. Little by little military leaders gained
possession of the strongholds, and subsequently became
almost independent chiefs. Then, too, the royal officials,
styled <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">gasindi</span></i>, likewise exercised great power. And even
as the dukes finally asserted their independence from the
king, so counts and <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sculdasci</span></i> sought emancipation from
the ducal sway, although without immediate success. In
the first century, after the conquest, there was no law, no
recognised protection for the vanquished, nor was the
authority of the bishops and clergy in any way respected.
The history of the Longobard rule shows it to have been
so tremendously oppressive as to apparently crush the very
life of the people, so that even at the most favourable
moments no serious revolts were attempted. Even the
example of the free cities in the South failed to excite them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as we have already noted, the Church,
having gained meanwhile a great increase of power,
refused to tolerate the pride and arrogance of barbarians
who showed her so little respect. Hence the Pope
resolved to expel these strangers by the help of others,
and called the Franks into Italy. Charlemagne, the
founder of the new Empire, could not regard the Latins,
to whom the growing civilisation of his states was so
much indebted, with the inextinguishable barbarian contempt
felt by the Longobards. He sought to extend his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
conquests and his power. He wished to assist the Pope,
in order to be consecrated by him and obtain his moral
support. Therefore he came to Italy, and the already
disintegrated Longobards could ill withstand the firm
unity of the Franks, strengthened as it was by the prestige
of his own victories. In vain the Longobards had
already chosen and sworn fealty to another monarch; in
vain they prepared for defence. After two hundred and
five years of assured and almost unchecked domination,
their kingdom was overthrown for ever. In 774 Charlemagne
became master of Italy, and in the year 800 was
crowned emperor by the Pope in Rome. Thus the
Western Empire became reconstituted and consecrated in
a new shape, entirely separate and independent from the
Empire of the East. The Franks deprived the Longobards
of all their dominions, excepting the Duchy of
Benevento in Southern Italy. The power of the Pope
was greatly increased by his assumption of the right of
anointing the emperor, who rewarded him with rich
donations and promised additions of territory. Rome,
however, was ruled as a free municipality; and Venice,
after the manner of the Greek cities in the South, had
already asserted her freedom. Such was the state of Italy
after the last barbarian invasion&mdash;that, namely, of the
Franks.</p>

<p>As usual, the new masters appropriated one-third of
the land; but the condition of the natives was now
decidedly changed for the better. Roman law was
recognised as the code of the vanquished, and this is
an evident sign that it was never entirely obsolete during
the two centuries of Longobard rule. Charlemagne
greatly improved the condition of the Latins, and sometimes
promoted them to <i><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">honours</span></i>, <i>i.e.</i>, to offices of royal
appointment. But the special characteristic of his reign
in Italy was the new hierarchy he established there. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
destroyed the power of the dukes, whose attitude was too
threatening to the unity of the Empire, and raised instead
the position of the counts. Even in the Marches, or
border-provinces, he retained no dukes, but replaced them
by marquises (<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mark-grafen</span>, <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Praefecti limitum</span>). In this
manner the ancient unity of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitatus</span></i>, or <i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Gau</span></i>, became
likewise the basis of the new barbarian society. Nor did
Charlemagne stop at this point, but began to distribute
offices, lands, and possessions in <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">beneficio</span></i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, in fief&mdash;and
therefore on condition of obligatory military service. This
proved the beginning of a social revolution, possibly
originated at an earlier date, but now carried to completion
under the name of feudalism. Not the emperor
only, but kings, counts, and marquises also granted lands,
revenues, and offices in fief, in order to obtain a sufficient
supply of vassals. Thus an infinite number of new
potentates was created: <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">vassalli</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">valvassori</span></i>, and <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">valvassini</span></i>,
the latter being lowest in degree. Gradually the
whole society of the Middle Ages took a feudal shape;
the recipient of a grant of land was bound to yield military
service, at the head of the peasants employed on his
ground. Similar privileges, similar obligations, accompanied
every donation of land or bestowal of office; for
even official posts were generally supplemented by a
concession of land or of revenue. Thus the Germanic
tendency to division and subdivision in small groups was
satisfied, while, at the same time, the Empire, the cities,
and even the Church itself, assumed a feudal form.
The bishops in their turn soon began to possess benefices,
and gradually rose to increased power, until we find them
in the position of so many counts and barons. Both in
their own persons, and those of their subordinates, they
enjoy immunity from ordinary laws and tribunals&mdash;an
inestimable advantage, serving to enhance their independence
and unite large clusters of population beneath their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
sheltering sway. Feudalism, accordingly, is a new order, a
new and thoroughly Germanic aristocracy, yet at the same
time it is the root of a veritable revolution in barbaric
society, the which revolution will continue to grow and
extend through many vicissitudes. Step by step the
Crown will begin to exempt the benefices or fiefs of the
vassals from subjection to the count, and will then declare
them hereditary by means of a series of laws, all designed
for the purpose of irritating the lesser potentates against
their superiors, and of giving increased strength to the
royal authority; but which served, on the contrary, to open
a way of redemption to the downtrodden people. All this,
however, was still unforeseen in the days of Charlemagne.
He organised the feudal system, and kept his realm united
and flourishing, although soon after his death (814) the
Empire was split into several kingdoms.</p>

<p>The rule of the Franks in Italy lasted to the death of
Charles the Fat, in 888. And throughout this rule of
115 years, the revolution to which we have alluded
was steadily making way. On all sides the number
of benefices or fiefs continually grew, and year by year
exemptions increased at an equal rate. These were conceded
more easily to prelates than to others, since when
laymen received benefices they were entitled to leave
them to their heirs, and thus became inconveniently
powerful. This state of things proved very favourable
to cities in which bishops held residence. At first
the count was sole ruler of the city, save the portion
appertaining to the Crown, and called <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">gastaldiale</span></i>, as being
under the command of a <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">gastaldo</span></i>, or steward; then, as
the power of the bishop increased, another portion was
exempted from the count's jurisdiction, as being <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">vescovile</span></i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, the property of the bishop. Step by step this portion
was enlarged until it included nearly the whole of the
town: many cities, in fact, were ruled solely by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
bishop. Thus the fibres of barbarian society were
weakened, and we might almost say unknit, by a method
that would have served to keep it in subjection to the
supreme authority of the monarch, but for the fact that
the people, deemed to be dead, was not only breathing, but
on the point of asserting its strength against nobles, kings
and emperors, prelates, and Popes.</p>

<p>Two revolts in the cause of liberty successively took
place, and both began under the Carlovingians, and continued
during the reigns of their successors. The first
enervated and enfeebled the barbarian society to which
the soil of Italy was so ill suited; the second prepared
the way for the rise of communes. With the death of
Charles the Fat the rule of the Franks lapsed, and
barbarian invasions likewise ceased. The Germanic tribes
had settled down on Italian soil and were becoming civilised.
Nevertheless, Italy had still to pass through a string
of revolutions and years of ill fortune. At the dissolution
of the Empire of the Franks, certain counts and marquises,
especially the latter, who, by the union of several counties,
had gained the power of dukes, were found asserting
extravagant pretensions, even endeavouring to form independent
states, and often with success. To this day, in
fact, there are reigning families descended from Frankish
marquises and counts. To compass their destruction
benefices and immunities had been granted in vain: their
power was not to be so easily extinguished. For, even in
Italy, where, owing to the different character of the country,
the ancient civilisation had tenaciously lingered on, and now
began to awake to new life, and where, too, the Papacy
and the Greeks of Byzantium had impeded the absolute
triumph of Germanic institutions, feudal counts and marquises
now arose to contest the crown. Next followed long
years of renewed devastation and conflict, ending by the
crown being retained in the grasp of German emperors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
kings. The first wars and quarrels were carried on by
Berengarius of Friuli and Guido of Spoleto, with other
Italian and foreign nobles, a German king, two Burgundian
monarchs, and finally by King Otho of Germany, who
remained victor. It was during these seventy odd years
of continued strife that Italian kings first reigned in Italy,
though with an always uncertain and disputed rule. Then
came a forty years' peace (961&ndash;1002), during which Otho
I., II., III. reigned in turn, and another Italian marquis,
Hardouin of Ivrea, disputed the crown of Italy with the
German kings. But in 1014 Hardouin was vanquished
by Henry of Germany, surnamed the <i>Saint</i>, to whom
succeeded Conradin of the Franconian or Salic dynasty.</p>

<p>These two German sovereigns completed the feudal
revolution, already mentioned by us, the which, begun by
the Carlovingians, and continued by the Othos, had failed
nevertheless to assure the supremacy of kings and emperors
over Italy. But, at all events, seeing that the Othos had
purposely exempted numerous lesser vassals from rendering
allegiance to the counts and barons, and had accorded
many cities to prelates; also seeing that the renascence
of communes was considerably promoted by all the aforesaid
exemptions, some writers conceived the idea that this
renascence was chiefly owed to the initiative of the Othos.
But these emperors had a very different aim in view, and
had failed to achieve it. They sought to undermine the
strength of all possible assailants of the Crown, when
threatened by revolts such as that of the Marquis of
Ivrea. For this reason Henry the Saint continued to
favour the greater feudatories at the expense of "holders
of honours"&mdash;that is to say, of counts and marquises&mdash;and
in fact almost annihilated the latter class. Conradin
the Salic carried out the scheme more completely,
by favouring even the minor feudatories and making
benefices hereditary. From that moment the victory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the German sovereigns over the feudal lords was assured;
for vassals once rendered masters of their fiefs owed
obedience to the Crown alone, and thus the pride of the
great nobles was permanently abased. Not so the new
popular pride, which had grown to be a power unawares.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we find a multitude of facts showing that
the condition of the Roman race was continually improving;
that feudal society, by the action of its own sovereigns,
was daily losing substance and strength; that as
the Latin civilisation revived by the natural force of
events, it changed, assimilated, and absorbed the principles
of Germanic society. Even before the two races came
into conflict, the traditions of the conquered had frequently
combated and overcome those of victors. The latter,
indeed, had already accepted the Roman law to some
extent, when the once subject race pleaded the sanction
of their municipal statutes.</p>

<p>Italians were in a state of ferment and of radical transformation
when the first signs of a revival of the communes
appeared. Neither the barbarian rule nor the Empire
had ever really mastered the social order of the peninsula;
and exactly when feudalism was first founded and seemed
likely to spread everywhere and assure the quiet supremacy
of the emperors over Italy, fresh causes of peril and
strife suddenly sprang into existence. Papacy and clergy
attained to loftier and more menacing power; the immunities
lavished on prelates, from dread of the laity, rendered
them temporal potentates dependent on the emperors,
while as spiritual dignitaries they owed obedience to the
Pope: thus practically enjoying a double investiture. This
led to much disorder and scandalous corruption in the
Church, since prelates were converted into feudal lords,
holding sway over cities, making war on other territories,
keeping open court, and indulging in every worldly pleasure.
The Popes wished to re-establish discipline, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
maintain absolute rule over the bishops, and nominate
them unhindered; but this was opposed by the emperor,
since the temporal authority of the prelates made them
logically subject to his rule as well. Thus began the
famous war of investitures between the Papacy and the
Empire, the issue of which was so long undecided. Meanwhile
neither the Church, the Empire, nor the feudal
system could obtain complete mastery over the social
movement, and the confusion was increased by their continual
disputes. This state of things weakened even the
authority of the prelates; and then the communes, having
necessarily learnt the art of self-government during the
period when dioceses were left vacant, having noted the
prosperity of the Southern republics, and found their
strength increased by the extension of commerce and the
feudal disorganisation, finally saw that the moment to
achieve freedom had arrived. Even in cities ruled by lay
nobles, things followed the same course, since to side
either with the Empire or the Church always served to
excite much enmity against those in power, and procured
many allies for the weaker party.</p>

<p>Accordingly the eleventh century witnessed the arisal of
communes throughout Italy, and the joy of independence
once realised, it was impossible to return to a state of
vassalage, whether under bishops, counts, or the Empire
itself. At first these communes were hemmed in on all
sides by a vast number of dukes, counts, and barons of
various degrees of strength, inasmuch as the feudal order
was still very powerful and still supreme in all country
districts. Of German descent and trained to arms, these
nobles fought in their own interest, although nominally
for the Empire and its rights, against the new communal
order that suddenly faced them with such menacing strength.
They swooped down from their strongholds to bar the
trade of the towns; they levied tolls, threatened violence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
and tried to treat free men as their vassals. Thereupon
the indignant citizens were stirred to vengeance from time
to time, and often ended by razing great fortresses to the
ground. On the other hand, the nobles still remaining
in the cities became wearied of living among men who
no longer respected the distinctions of class or race, and
often departed to rejoin their friends. They frequently
emigrated in such numbers that the citizens suffered injury
by it, and issued decrees forbidding their exodus. The
Pope gave encouragement to the communes, because the
reduction of his prelates' temporal power did not displease
him, and the abasement of the Empire was indispensable
to his aims. Thus the struggle of the working classes
against feudalism finally began, and with it the real history
of our communes.</p>

<p>But it should not be thought that the Commune arose
to champion the rights of man or in the name of national
independence. Nothing of the kind. The Empire was
still held to be the sole and universal fount of right.
Almost to the close of the fifteenth century, in fact, all cities,
whether Guelph or Ghibelline, foes or friends of the
Empire, continued to indite their State papers in its <span class="locked">name.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span>
The revived republics always acknowledged its supremacy,
and their own dependence, almost, one might say, as
though in claiming a new and more general exemption, they
only sought to be, as it were, their own dukes or counts.
They combated the nobles and combated the Empire; but
victory once assured, they recognised the authority of the
emperor, and prayed him to sanction the privileges they had
won. Nor was the destruction of the Empire at any time
desired by the Popes; its protection was often indispensable
to them, and they too recognised it as the legitimate
heir of ancient Rome, and consequently as the only source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
of political and civil rights. Their purpose was to subject
the temporal to the spiritual power. Therefore, during
the rise of the Commune, theocracy and feudalism, Papacy
and Empire, still subsisted together and always in conflict.
The Commune had to struggle long against obstacles of
all kinds; but it was destined to triumph, and to create
the third estate and people by whom alone modern society
could be evolved from the chaos of the Middle Ages.
This constitutes the chief historical importance of the
Italian Commune.</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">THE</span> origin of Florence is wrapped in
great obscurity, and little light is to be
derived from chroniclers, who either
avoided the subject altogether or clouded
it over with legends. Much has been
written of late touching these chroniclers
and on the value and varying credibility of their accounts.
But in endeavouring to ascertain everything, and push
research too subtly, long and learned disputes have sometimes
arisen on particulars which can never, perhaps, be
verified and are scarcely worth knowing, while more
significant and easily investigated points have been left
untouched. By this method some risk is incurred of
building up from those writers a species of occult science
for the sole benefit of the initiated, whereas all that is
absolutely known of the origin of Florence may be
expressed in a few words.</p>

<p>The Florentine Commune being of tardier birth than
many others, its historians and chroniclers were likewise
of later date, since no commune possesses a written
history until conscious of its own personality. Thus, it
was only in the twelfth century that yearly records were
first started, registering some of the more important
events of Florence, giving dates, and names of places and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
persons, while, at the same time, lists were made of the
Consuls, the first magistrates of the Commune, and afterwards
supplemented with the names of the Podestà, who
succeeded to the Consuls. These magistrates being
changed yearly, and even more frequently, this catalogue
served as a chronological guide, and was soon converted
into a register of contemporaneous events in the town.</p>

<p>A very early fragment of these annals is preserved in
the Vatican, and is written on the back of a sheet forming
part of a <span class="locked">codex<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> of Longobard laws. It contains
eighteen records, running from 1110 to 1173, in different
handwritings, all, however, of the twelfth century, with
some blunders and no chronological arrangement. Nevertheless
these records are of much importance, being the
earliest we possess. A similar and longer series of records
of much later date, running from 1107 to 1247, is to be
found in a thirteenth-century <span class="locked">MS.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> in the National Library
at Florence.</p>

<p>Both collections have been recently republished and
illustrated by Dr. Hartwig, under the title of "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Annales
florentini</span>," i. and "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Annales florentini</span>," <span class="locked">ii.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> The Codex
containing the second series also comprises the oldest list
extant of Consuls and Podestà, from 1196 to 1267, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
has been rendered more complete by the results of fresh
<span class="locked">research.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span></p>

<p>Other and similar records must have been certainly
made, first in Latin, then in Italian, and, in passing from
this family to that, from hand to hand, enlarged, revised,
and altered according to the taste, or even the fancy, of
their transcribers. But, from the remains of those records
and all matter copied from them by the chroniclers, it
may be inferred with almost absolute certainty that they
told little or nothing of the origin of the Commune. We
are therefore inclined to believe that this was neither the
outcome of virulent conflict nor of downright revolution,
for either would have been undoubtedly registered in the
annals, but that it gradually evolved and developed amid
struggles of secondary importance.</p>

<p>If in these days we desire to ascertain the origin of the
Florentine Commune, it is only natural that older generations
should have felt even a keener interest in the theme.
They, however, lacked the art and critical method enabling
us to track and often lay bare the darkest and most
remote periods of history by means of public documents,
although many now perished must have been at their
disposal. But our forefathers were readier to draw on
their own imagination, and thus a legend regarding the
origin of the city was created, and soon became widely
diffused.</p>

<p>The primary germ from which this legend was developed
and expanded must date from the twelfth century,
seeing that it was known and recorded by the chronicler
Sanzanome, who wrote during the first years of the
thirteenth century. It cannot be much older than this,
seeing that the events and dates to which it alludes, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
however vague and shadowy a fashion, carry it down
beyond the eleventh century. Several inedited copies of
this legend are still to be found in Florentine <span class="locked">libraries,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span>
and it has been published in three different compilations.
The most ancient of these, in Latin, is contained in a
codex dating from the end of the thirteenth or beginning
of the fourteenth <span class="locked">century.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> The second, in Italian, is in
a Lucchese <span class="locked">MS.,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> compiled between 1290 and 1342; at
one point it gives a record of <span class="locked">1264,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> and was probably
written at that time. The third and later version, known
as the "Libro fiesolano", is comprised in an Italian codex
dated 1382, in the Marucellian Library at Florence, was
discovered by Signor Gargani and published by him in
<span class="locked">1854.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> Dr. Hartwig discovered the second, which is
identical, save in language, with the first, and published
all three under the title of "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chronica de Origine Civitatis</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
found in the Lucca MS.; although in other MSS.
it is styled "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Memoria del Nascimento di Firenze.</span>"</p>

<p>Such was the material at the service of the old chroniclers,
and all they had to rely upon regarding the origin
of Florence. The earliest chronicler of whom any
remains are extant is the judge and notary Sanzanome,
who, as already noted by us, wrote his "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gesta Florentinorum</span>"
at the beginning of the thirteenth century. We
find him mentioned more than once in Florentine documents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
from 1188&ndash;1245.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Although we cannot be certain
that this name always referred to the same individual, it
is certain that the same chronicler records his presence
in the war of Semifonte in the year 1202, and in that of
Montalto in 1207. Besides, his work is found in a
Florentine codex of the thirteenth century, and if not in
his own hand, in the character of about the same <span class="locked">period.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span>
This first attempt at Florentine history, written in Latin
by a judge and notary, supposed by Milanesi and Hartwig
to have been a native of a neighbouring town, but
resident in Florence, has a stamp of its own, very different
from that of all subsequent Florentine chronicles. Sanzanome
says nothing as to the origin of the Commune and
its internal constitution. After a vague and hasty allusion
to the old <span class="locked">legend,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> he starts with the war and destruction
of Fiesole in 1125, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">cum eius occasione Florentia sumpsisset
originem.</span>" Thus, from the beginning, he shows us
the Commune already established, with its consuls and
captains, and proceeds to recount its conflicts with
neighbouring powers in a stilted, rhetorical fashion, with
uncertain and often erroneous dates, and with speeches in
strained imitation of ancient Roman historians. Consequently
some writers refused to assign any historic value
to his work. But, on the other hand, critics of greater
weight and impartiality, such as Hartwig, Hegel, and
Paoli, have recognised that the work of this notary, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
was almost a precursor of the fifteenth-century humanists,
is a literary phenomenon, and that the fact of its isolation
makes it the more remarkable as a proof of ancient
Florentine culture, and also because we find beneath its
rhetorical flourishes much useful information on the early
history of Florence.</p>

<p>Hence all the other chroniclers had to face one and
the same problem: how to write a history, or even a
bare chronicle of the earliest beginnings of Florence, from
the scant and fragmentary accounts at their disposal?
The notary Sanzanome shirked the difficulty by saying
nothing of the foundation of the town, and then expanding
his narrative with rhetorical flights, fictitious speeches,
and descriptions of battles, in which his own fancy and
imitation of the classics played the main part. But this
method was neither congenial nor possible to the simpler
folk of a later day, who sought to write as they spoke,
and whose culture was slighter, or at all events very different
from the notary's. These chroniclers, therefore, had
no basis to build upon save one legend and a few scraps
of information that could not possibly satisfy their
patriotic pride.</p>

<p>Fortunately for their purpose, just at this time&mdash;namely,
towards the middle of the thirteenth century&mdash;an event of
great literary importance occurred, serving to put the
Florentine chroniclers on a new track. A Dominican
monk, one Martin of Troppau, in Bohemia, surnamed
therefore <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Oppaviensis</span></i>, vulgarly known as Martin Polono,
chaplain, apostolic penitentiary, and afterwards archbishop,
wrote an historical work which, although of no remarkable
merit, had an extraordinary and rapid success. It
was a species of manual of universal history, chronologically
arranged under the names of the various emperors
and Popes, down to the year 1268. Its author afterwards
carried it down to a few years later, with an introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
treating of the times anterior to the Roman <span class="locked">Empire.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span>
This book was mechanically arranged, and stuffed with
anecdotes, blunders, and fables; but was the work of an
eminent prelate, inspired with the Guelphic spirit. The
author's method of arranging the events of the Middle
Ages under the headings of Popes and Emperors served
as a leading thread through the vast labyrinth. It is
certain that his book was rapidly diffused throughout
Europe, especially in Italy, and above all in Florence. As
Prof. Scheffer Boichorst remarks: "Its first translator
was a Florentine, and another Florentine, Brunetto Latini,
the first to make use of it." In fact, the Florence libraries
have numerous copies of it in Latin MSS. of the fourteenth
century, while others of the same period comprise
an Italian translation that, according to the results of
learned <span class="locked">research,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> must have been produced in Florence
towards <span class="locked">1279.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> This fact alone is a most luminous proof
of the rapid popularity and diffusion of the work. As it
was a common practice with the scribes of that period to
insert alterations of their own in the works they copied
out, it may have easily occurred to some transcriber of
this translation to enrich it here and there with the more
important of the few facts then known of the early history
of their city. But as Martin Polono's work was only
brought down to the end of the thirteenth century, and
items of Florentine history had increased in number and
extent, so it came about that all these additions forsook universal
history and were solely devoted to that of Florence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
In this way the former merely served, as it were, as an
introduction to the latter; a result highly gratifying to
municipal self-complacency.</p>

<p>One of the first works introducing Martin Polono's
book, translated, shortened, re-written, and with several
interpolated Florentine items, is that entitled "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Le Vite
dei Pontefici et Imperatori Romani</span>," once attributed to
Petrarch, and existing in several Florentine fourteenth-century
codices. In this work, however, Florentine
history is still given very secondary importance, and indeed
when at last, after various sequels and alterations, it finally
appeared in print in 1478, Polono's primitive method was
still maintained by giving summaries here and there of the
lives of the other emperors and Popes. But other versions
soon appeared in which Florentine history filled a larger
<span class="locked">space.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> In a fourteenth-century MS. of the Naples
National Library, first examined by Pertz, we find
Martin Polono's share of the work considerably curtailed,
and the history of Florence not only much extended, but
likewise carried down to <span class="locked">1309.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> Here one begins to see
that the writer was chiefly interested in Florentine events.
Professor Hartwig was so struck by this fact as to be at
the pains to extract everything relating to Florence from
the MS., and print it apart, as one of the authorities probably
recurred to by <span class="locked">Villani.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> In a chronicle attributed
to Brunetto Latini the same purpose is still more clearly
indicated. Some of the Florentine news contained in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
were long and frequently extracted, printed, and employed;
notably the list of Consuls and Podestà used by Ammirato,
and a narrative of the Buondelmonti tragedy (1215),
differing considerably from Villani's version of the tale.
It was speedily decided that the author must have written
in 1293, since he records an event of that year, and says
that he witnessed it with his own <span class="locked">eyes.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> Later, this
Chronicle was attributed to Brunetto Latini, although the
narrative is carried down to a date when Dante's master
must have certainly ceased to <span class="locked">exist.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> During his learned
researches in Florence Dr. Hartwig discovered a MS.
that, in all probability, is the original autograph of the
<span class="locked">Chronicle.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> Although mutilated&mdash;starting only from
1181&mdash;this Codex is doubly precious, as it clearly shows
the method on which this and many similar works were
compiled. There is a middle column containing the usual
mangled version of Martin <span class="locked">Polono<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span>; and here on the
margins, between the rubrics and sometimes even the
lines, are added notices of general history, drawn from
other sources, and special records of Florentine events.</p>

<p>The history is thus brought down to 1249, where a gap
occurs extending to 1285, from which year the author
continues his narrative to <span class="locked">1303.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> But in this second part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the character of the work is entirely changed. Having
no longer Martin Polono as a guide, he now forsakes that
prelate's method. The affairs of the Empire and the
Church are reduced to still smaller proportions, more
space is given to those of Florence, and instead of being
scattered haphazard over the narrative, they are now
united and carried steadily on. Thus we see a real
chronicle of Florence gradually developing before us and
acquiring a special value of its own. Its discoverer, Dr.
Hartwig, at first considered it an autograph, but finally
conceived doubts on that score. The great disorder of
the manuscript; its mutilated commencement; the gap
between thirty-six years in the middle; the absence of
certain records, comprised in certain excerpts from it,
quoted by old writers; the discovery that many of these
writers quoted from another MS. of the Chronicle belonging
to the Gaddi Library; all this justified his statement
that the problem could not be finally solved without the
aid of the Gaddi Codex, which he had not yet been able
to discover.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Professor Santini maintained, in a
prize essay, that the Gaddi Codex could only be a copy of
that found by Hartwig, and that the latter must be the
mutilated original manuscript. After a short time the
question was ultimately decided by another student of our
Istituto Superiore, Signor Alvisi, who, having unearthed
the Gaddi Codex in the Laurentian Library, found it to be
a fifteenth-century <span class="locked">copy.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> Here the various fragments&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>arranged
in separate columns in the original MS.&mdash;are
joined with the remainder of the text, though often in an
arbitrary fashion. Here, too, there is the gap between
1249&ndash;85, but the Chronicle, instead of starting from 1181,
begins, like Martin Polono's first compilation, with Jesus
Christ&mdash;<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">primo e sommo Pontefice</span></i>&mdash;and the Emperor Octavian.
Thus, it may now be affirmed, that the Codex in
the Florence National Library is a genuine and, as it
were, photographic representation of the method employed
for the earliest compilations of Florentine historiography.
It allows us to see the author at work, as it were, before
our eyes.</p>

<p>Another, but far less perfect, specimen of this kind of
production is afforded by the Lucca MS., to which previous
allusion has been made. The author carefully tells
us that it was composed between the years 1290 and 1342.
He transcribes the whole legend of the origin of Florence,
and then gives his Italian <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">pasticcio</span></i> of Martin Polono,
beginning from the Emperor Octavian. But he intersperses
it with "many things relating to the affairs of
Tuscany, and especially of Florence ... the greater part
being found in divers books on Tuscany, of which some
contain more, some less" (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">qual na più, qual na meno</span></i>).
Having reached the year 1309 in this fashion, he continues
his narrative by borrowing from Villani, several
books of whose history had already appeared in 1341,
and with this assistance carries his work down to 1342.
He continues by reproducing a Latin description of
Florence written in 1339, and then gives the Latin introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
that Martin Polono had added to his history.
The compiler of this Lucca Codex avows that his method
is neither logical nor chronological; but craves the reader's
indulgence, saying that in this work he had first put
together all the Italian and then all the Latin portions,
with the intention of arranging them better afterwards, by
fusing them together and writing the whole in Latin.
This intention he seems to have found no time to fulfil.
From this Codex also, all the portions relating to Florence
were subsequently extracted and <span class="locked">printed.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> As may be
seen, the compiler's method is always the same, although
in this case heavier and more mechanical than usual, for
lack of any inherent connection between the different
parts. The only novelty consists in transcribing the
entire legend to make it serve as an introduction to
Florentine history; an example that, as will be seen, was
afterwards followed by others.</p>

<p>But however flattering to Florentine self-love this system
of fusing the history of the Commune with that of the
universe might be, it was clearly apparent that the former
remained crushed, as it were, by the contact. Hence
even the fourteenth century witnessed attempts to expound
it apart. Paolo Pieri begins his Chronicle from 1080, the
year from which the other writers also date their earliest
historical account of Florence, and continues it, with
slight allusions to the Popes and slighter to the emperors,
down to 1305, including the scanty Florentine records
"gleaned from many chronicles and books, with certain
novel matters seen by me, Paolino di Piero, and written
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad memoriam</span></i>." On the other hand, Simone della Tosa,
who died in 1380, begins his "Annals" with a list of
Consuls and Podestà (1196&ndash;1278), and then passes to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
death of Countess Matilda (1115) and on to 1346, supplementing
towards the close his meagre account of Florentine
affairs with details about his own family. But simple
summaries such as these, consisting only of a few pages,
were more inadequate than ever to satisfy the needs of a
city that now, in the fourteenth century, had already won
a foremost place in Italy, was proudly asserting equality
with Rome, and aspired to have a history similar to that
of the ancient metropolis of the world.</p>

<p>Such was the ambitious problem that Giovanni Villani
as shown by his own words, proposed to solve. In the
year 1300, he says, "being in Rome for the Jubilee, admiring
the grand memories of that city, reading the
glorious deeds narrated by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Titus
Livy, Paul Orosio, and other masters of history, who
recounted, not the events of Rome alone, but likewise
strange events of the universal world: I borrowed their
style and <span class="locked">form."<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> Reflecting that "our old Florentines
had left few and confused records of past deeds in our city
of <span class="locked">Florence,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> and that our city, the child and creature of
Rome, was on the upward path, and about to achieve great
things, whereas Rome was on the decline," I resolved "to
bring into this volume and new chronicle all the events
and beginnings of the city of Florence, ... and give
henceforth <i>in full</i> the deeds of the Florentines, and <i>briefly</i>
the notable affairs of the rest of the <span class="locked">universe."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> Thus,
according to Villani, the course to be pursued was to connect
the history of Florence with that of the world, as
others had done before him, but in such wise that Florence
should not be the loser, but rather play the chief part.
Hence his work is no longer a mechanical mosaic; he
arranges his history, dividing it in books and chapters,
after the manner of the ancients. We do not know all
the authorities from whom his work was derived, for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
question has not yet been completely investigated. But
we know that they were many in number. For general
history, Martin Polono was still the main source; but
Villani also drew from the "Gesta Imperatorum et Pontificum"
of Thomas <span class="locked">Tuscus,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> the "Vita di San Giovanni
Gualberto," the "Cronache di San Dionigi" (an Italian
translation of which was printed&mdash;1476&mdash;before the
original text), and the "Libro del Conquisto d'Oltremare,"
which was a history of the Crusades, translated from the
French into almost every other language during the
Middle <span class="locked">Ages.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span></p>

<p>That Villani is a very valuable authority in Florentine
history dating from the end of the thirteenth century, is
a fact well known to all, and need not be discussed here.
As to the origin of the city, he has little that is genuinely
historical to tell us. His accounts begin, as usual, from
1080, are more or less identical with those disseminated by
other writers, not unfrequently charged with the same
blunders, and often in the same words. This singular
resemblance between many of the Florentine chroniclers
when treating of early times, and remarked upon later,
was easily explained so long as it was taken for granted
that some chroniclers had copied from others. But when
it could be proved, as was often the case, that the same
resemblance existed even between totally independent
writers, the problem was not so readily solved. For
this reason, Prof. Scheffer-Boichorst, in noting the fact,
after impartial and keen investigation, suggested the theory
that all the different chroniclers had drawn from some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
common source, of which nothing was now known. Seeing
that Tolomeo of Lucca, whose Annals were already
concluded before Villani began to colour his design, often
quotes from "Gesta" and "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Acta Florentinorum</span>," "Gesta"
and "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Acta Lucensium</span>," the German critic assigned the
name of "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gesta Florentinum</span>" to what, in his opinion, must
have been the original source used by all the chroniclers
of Florence down to the beginning of the fourteenth century.
This hypothesis became generally accepted as the
most probable explanation of a fact that was otherwise
inexplicable. But when attempts were made to precisely
define the nature and limits of the "Gesta"&mdash;to define,
not only its language, but in which year it was begun,
in which ended, together with the style and exact character
both of the work and its author&mdash;the question then stood
on very disputable ground. Accordingly, I will leave
discussions of this kind on one side, as beyond the sphere
of a general outline. Besides, I must agree with Prof.
C. <span class="locked">Paoli<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> in considering that the "Gesta" cannot have
been a strictly individual work, but rather a collection of
Florentine news, originally of very meagre proportions,
but gradually enriched by fresh annalistic matter and new
additions, as it passed from hand to hand. Some compilation
of this kind, but of greater weight and repute
(now unluckily perished), must have fallen into the hands
of various chroniclers, who made use of it in turn, unconscious
that it had served others before them. And these
chroniclers were again copied by several of a later period.</p>

<p>Villani begins with the Tower of Babel and the confusion
of tongues and then passes on to the legendary origin
of Florence, dividing it in chapters and expounding it as
though it were genuine history, but inserting various
alterations, to which we shall refer later on. He then
proceeds with a general history of the Middle Ages, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
from the year 1080 engrafts on this stock all the accounts
of Florence he had been able to collect, and even colours
these by a variety of other legends much diffused among
the people at the time, and often, also, by the addition of
fantastic considerations of his own. What amount of
accurate knowledge can be derived from all this? Substantially
we find a single legend, and a small number of
historical facts of undoubted value, though not free from
errors, floating, as elsewhere, in an ocean of events quite
unconnected with Florence, intermixed with scraps of
misty traditions or legends, arbitrarily interpreted and
explained. Therefore, the first question to be decided is
that of the origin and value of the legend itself. Can any
historical information be derived from it, either directly or
indirectly? The second question is: Can it be ascertained
with any certainty what original nucleus of authentic
information the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gesta Florentinorum</span>" must have contained?
The latter at least presents no serious difficulty,
seeing that when we compare the various chroniclers,
particularly those who worked independently, and extract
what Florentine material they used in common and often
gave in the same words, the main point is won. But,
after all this, and after trying to extract some substance
(scant enough, as will be seen) from the legend, very little
genuine information is gained. It is therefore an absolute
necessity to seek the aid of all public and private documents
contained in our Archives, and of all learned
modern investigations regarding mediæval history in
general, and that of Florence in particular. Florentine
historical research, first inaugurated by Ammirato, was
diligently pursued in the eighteenth century by Borghini,
Lami, and numerous other scholars, down to the present
day. Nevertheless, the definite results of these prolonged
inquiries, this vast display of learning, were still
very few. For instance, we find that even the illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Gino Capponi, after a short introduction to his History
of Florence, is compelled, like the ancients, to leap to the
death of Countess Matilda, and makes his first mention,
so to say, of the Commune after it had already existed for
some time. Then the history of almost two centuries,
to the year 1215, or thereabouts, is summed up in twelve
pages, and only from the thirteenth forward are events
related really in full.</p>

<div id="ip_54" class="figcenter" style="width: 596px;">
<img src="images/i_078.jpg" width="596" height="406" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">ETRUSCAN TOMBSTONES, FROM THE MERCATO VECCHIO, FLORENCE.</div></div>

<p>But in these days the study of mediæval documents
has made extraordinary progress, above all in Germany,
and accordingly the Florentine question has been again
reopened. Dr. O. Hartwig was the first to apply his
learning to the task, employing the scientific method. He
not only examined all that was published on the subject,
but made fresh researches in Italian libraries and archives,
further aided by precious notes of documents newly discovered
in Tuscany by D. Wüstenfeld. Thus, in the
work from which we have frequently quoted, he was
enabled to give a collection of valuable documents and
of learned dissertations which have been already turned
to account, will serve as a basis for future researches,
and would be still better known and appreciated were
they penned in a more popular style. Much has been
found, very much read by Prof. Perrens, who has
devoted his life to Florentine history, and already published
eight volumes of his work. His first volume, of
five hundred pages, only extends to the middle of the
thirteenth century, and therefore treats of the origin of
the city learnedly and at length. All Italians owe him
gratitude for this; but it must be confessed that his
untiring zeal, vast learning, and prodigious reading have
not always resulted in a due amount of historical accuracy,
and sureness of method. Treating of a period in which
all has to be built up on a very scanty number of known
facts, unless these facts are thoroughly ascertained disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
consequences are apt to ensue. For example, in
investigating the first origin of the Consuls, he still relies
on the document of Pogna, dated March 4, 1101, in
which they are named, and without remarking that
Capponi, from whom, nevertheless, he continually quotes,
had proved that, although long thought correct, this date
was erroneous, and should be altered to March 4, 1181,
Florentine style, the which signifies 1182 in the modern
style. Thus Prof. Perrens introduces Consuls long
before they were <span class="locked">born.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> Elsewhere he plunges into the
very intricate dispute as to the jurisdiction exercised over
their own territory by the Florentines of the twelfth
century. He repeats with the old chroniclers that in
1186 Frederic I. deprived them of all jurisdiction beyond
the city walls, but that they re-acquired it in 1188. He
adds that on the Emperor Frederic's decease in 1190, his
successor, Henry VI. "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comme don de joyeux evènement,
multiplie les privilèges.</span>" He fails to reflect that the
patent quoted in support of the latter assertion bears the
date of 1187, and that he gives the date in a note of his
<span class="locked">own.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> How is the reader to disentangle this skein? As
another example, we may add that the author gives as an
historical fact the legendary tale of the origin of the
Colombina festival held on Holy Saturday. The Florentines
are sent to the Crusades by their archbishop, Ranieri,
in 1099: that is several centuries before Florence possessed
an archbishop. Pazzino de Pazzi, in reward for his
feats of valour at the taking of Jerusalem, receives the
<i>mural crown</i> from Godfrey de Bouillon, together with
the right to change his arms and adopt the crosses and
dolphins, the which change was only effected by the Pazzi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
several centuries <span class="locked">later.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> Pazzino returns to Florence in
triumph, mounted on a car, of which the description is
given; and at a time when the Commune was not yet
<span class="locked">established,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> is received in the style of a Roman conqueror
by the people, the clergy, and the magistrates. He has
brought three stones from the Holy Sepulchre, and these
are the flints from which the sparks are still struck to fire
the Car of the Dove. All this is derived from Gamurrini's
"<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Storia genealogica</span>," an utterly valueless <span class="locked">work.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> Readers
may consider it strangely invidious on my part to be at
the pains to refer to certain blunders contained in a work
of which I am the first to recognise the merits, and by
which I have often profited. But it seemed necessary to
explain why, in spite of having praised, I should so seldom
quote it. The work undeniably comprises abundant
historic material, is written with vivacity and clearness,
contains many keen observations, and does honour to an
author to whom Italians are bound to be grateful. But
although for all these reasons it is a book deserving
attention, no possible use can be made of it, without
continually verifying the authorities cited in it.</p>

<p>Here a word must be said touching another and far
less imposing work, to which we have been able to refer
with far greater security. Already, in certain short
papers appearing in the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Archivio Storico Italiano</span>," Prof.
Santini had proved his power of keen research on the early
history of Florence, and has now had the happy idea of
collecting all the documents on the subject, both published
and unpublished, existing in the Florentine Archives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
After copying and verifying them from the originals, he
is now bringing them out in a bulky volume. It would
be well if he or other writers could complete the same
task in all cities, or at least in those of Tuscany, which had
so many ties in common. Meanwhile, his book will form
a new and solid foundation for Florentine historic research.
We are doubly grateful for his kindness in allowing us to
examine his press proofs. Thus we have been enabled to
profit by his forthcoming book in advance of its publication,
and shall have frequent occasion to quote from it.
Other works, unmentioned in the text, will be recorded
in the notes for our readers' benefit.</p>

<p>Turning away for the moment from codices and

<p class="in0">Nevertheless, it appears to have had a literary rather
than a purely popular origin. In fact, it is only a strange
medley of classical and mediæval traditions, chiefly taken
from books, and more or less arbitrarily altered, regarding
the siege of Troy, the flight of Æneas, and the origin of
Rome; and as municipal pride sought to connect the latter
with that of Florence, all the scanty and vague notices, or
rather traditions, existing on the subject had been carefully
scraped together. The legend begins with Adam, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
quickly leaving him aside, strides on to the foundation of
Fiesole by Atlas and his spouse, aided by the counsels of
Apollonius the astrologer. Fiesole was the first city built;
it was erected on the healthiest spot in Europe, and
hence its name&mdash;<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Fie sola</span></i>. The children of Atlas spread
over the land and populated it. The eldest son was
called Italo, and gave Italy its name; the third was
Sicano, who conquered and named Sicily. The second
son, Dardano, wandered farther a-field, and founded the
city of <span class="locked">Troy.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> The legend next passes rapidly to the
Trojan war, the flight of Æneas, and the foundation of
Rome, of which city Florence is the favourite offspring.
It then goes on to speak at much greater length, of
Catiline, regarding whom so many particulars are given,
that he must have been the subject of a separate legend
which either, when united with the rest, at a later date,
formed the so-called "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chronica de origine Civitatis</span>," or
was, more probably, anterior to this, and only amalgamated
with it in subsequent compilations.</p>

<p>After conspiring against Rome Catiline came to Fiesole,
whither the Romans pursued and attacked him, under
their consuls Metellus and Fiorinus. The latter falling
in battle, their army was totally defeated on the banks
of the Arno. But Julius Cæsar came to avenge them,
besieged and destroyed Fiesole; and then, on the same
spot where Fiorinus had fallen, a new city was built, and
called Fiorenza to commemorate his name. Catiline fled
to the Pistorian Appennines, but was pursued there and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
routed. So great was the number of the killed, that a
pestilence broke out, and from this Pistoia derived its
<span class="locked">name.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span></p>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 59</i>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>In the legend the nomenclature of Tuscan cities is
always explained on the same principles, Pisa, for instance,
being derived from <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">pesare</span></i> (to weigh). For the Romans
received their tributes there, and these were so numerous
that they had to be weighed in two different places. This
is why they spoke of the city in the plural, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Pisae Pisarum</span></i>.
Lucca comes from <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">lucere</span></i> (to shine), because it was the
first city converted to the light of Christianity. When
the <span class="locked">Franks<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> marched against the Longobards in the South
they halted at a place in central Italy, and left all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
aged people behind them. Thus the city built on that
site received the name, likewise in the plural, of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Senae
Senarum</span></i>. Florence, however, according to the legend,
derived its name from Fiorinus, although later writers
declared it to be taken from the word <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Fluentia</span></i>, because
it stood by the river Arno; others, again, from the
numerous flowers springing from its soil. It was built
in the likeness of Rome, with a capitol, forum, theatre, and
baths, and was consequently called Little Rome. Its
friends are always the friends of Rome; the foes of the
one are foes of the other.</p>

<p>After five hundred years, so runs the legend, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Totila
flagellum Dei</span></i> came and destroyed Florence, and immediately
rebuilt the rival city of Fiesole. This clearly
alludes to Attila, since he bore the title of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">flagellum Dei</span></i>, and
in the Middle Ages was the real type of the devastator and
destroyer of cities. As he never came to Florence he
was converted into Totila, who had been there, although
never designated by the same appellation. This exchange
of names was aided by their resemblance, nor is it the
sole example the Middle Ages afford of the confusion of
Attila with Totila. In the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Divina Commedia</span>" ("Inferno,"
xiii. 148&ndash;9) we find Dante attributing the destruction
of Florence to Attila, when he says:</p>

<div class="poem-container" xml:lang="it" lang="it">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Quei cittadin che poi la rifondarno<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sovra il cener che d'Attila rimase."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">And hereby he doubly deserts the legend; for, according
to that, Florence was rebuilt by the Romans and then,
naturally, on the pattern of Christian Rome, with
churches dedicated to St. Peter, St. John, St. Laurence,
&amp;c., as in the Eternal City.</p>

<p>Thereupon more than 500 <span class="locked">years<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span> elapsed in peace;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
but then Florence, finally resolving to be revenged on its
perpetual rival, suddenly attacked and destroyed Fiesole.
At this point we may remark that, if Florence had been
first founded in Cæsar's time, and adorned with Roman
monuments at a later date; if, after 500 <span class="locked">years,<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span> it was
destroyed by Totila, and then itself overthrew Fiesole
after another interval of 500 years, the chronology of the
legend clearly brings us to the eleventh century at least.
If we also add that the assault and partial destruction of
Fiesole really occurred in 1125, it follows that, as we
have noted, the legend cannot have been framed before
the twelfth century.</p>

<p>Here, then, it should end and give place to history. In
fact, Sanzanome, the earliest of the chroniclers, begins his
work with the destruction of Fiesole. But the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Libro
fiesolano</span>" sometimes introduces capricious turns in the
framework of the legend, and at this point makes an
addition worthy of note as an evidence of the mode
in which these fantastic stories were built up. The
added portion refers to the Uberti, powerful citizens
always opposed to popular government in Florence.
According to tradition, they came originally from Germany
with the Othos. Evidently, however, this theory
was repugnant to the author of the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Libro fiesolano</span>,"
possibly an adherent of the Uberti, and he therefore
remarks, with some heat, that, on the contrary, the
Uberti were descended from Catiline, "most noble king
of Rome," with Trojan blood running in his veins.
Catiline's son Uberto Cesare had a Fiesolan wife, who
bore him sixteen children; and he was afterwards sent by
Augustus to reconquer Saxony, which had risen in rebellion.
While in that country Uberto Catilina married a German
lady of high position, and from this union sprang "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
lineage of the good Ceto [Otho] of Sansognia." Thus it
is false that the Uberti were "born of the Emperor of
Germany, the truth being that the emperor was born of
their <span class="locked">race."<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> This addition, posterior to the rest of the
legend, shows that the author desired to exalt the Uberti;
but, remembering their constant hostility to the Florentine
government, declared them descended from Catiline and
his Fiesolan bride. Also, being unable to deny outright
their Ghibelline proclivities and Germanic origin, yet
unwilling to acknowledge their descent from the Othos,
he converts them into the latter's progenitors. Thus the
legend is brought into harmony with its compiler's views,
or rather, with his intent of magnifying his friends.</p>

<p>Inquiry into the sources of this legend would only
lead us astray, without throwing any new light on the
origin of Florence, since the fable has no real historical
value. We need only say that, besides Darses' "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">De
excidio Troiae</span>," the commentary to Virgil of Servius;
Orosio's History, Paolo Diacono's Roman History, and
the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Storia Miscella</span>," &amp;c., must have been consulted for
its <span class="locked">compilation.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> Leaving the question aside, we may
rather note that, although Villani and Malespini both
give the legend as a preface to their histories, they not
only refer to two separate compilations, but use them in a
totally different <span class="locked">way.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> This is another proof that even if
Malespini's chronicle were copied from Villani, it is not
always an exact reproduction. He refers to the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Libro
fiesolano</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> but enlarges it with two entire chapters of
his own, containing a complete story, probably derived
from some episode of the Catiline legend. And although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
teeming with the strangest anachronisms, it is better
written and far livelier than the rest.</p>

<p>In this tale we find Fiorino converted into a Roman
king, married to the most beautiful woman ever seen,
appropriately named Belisca. After the defeat and death
of her husband, Queen Belisca remained the captive of a
wicked knight named Pravus, but Catiline causes him to
be put to death, and carries off Belisca, of whom he is
desperately enamoured. The queen, however, is in
despair concerning the fate of her lovely daughter
Teverina, imprisoned in the house of one Centurione, and
adored by him. In kissing Teverina's beautiful hair this
man had exclaimed: "It is these that enchain me, for
lovelier locks have I never seen." On the day of
Pentecost the mother attended mass in the Fiesole
church, and with bitter tears bemoaned the loss of her
child. Her prayer was heard by a serving-maid, who
knew where Teverina was hidden, and revealed it to the
weeping mother. On receiving the news, Catiline
instantly attacked Centurione's palace, and, after a fierce
struggle, succeeded in capturing him. The prisoner owed
his life to Belisca's intercession; for, having regained her
child, she desired to save him, dressed his wounds, and
urged him to fly from Catiline's wrath. Centurione
consented to escape, and having mounted his horse,
implored permission to bid a last farewell to Teverina.
But when she appeared, he caught her in his arms, and
galloped away, followed by his men. The mother
fainted from grief, and Catiline, "with all his barons,"
a thousand horse and two thousand foot, pursued the
traitor to the castle of Naldo, ten miles off, and proceeded
to attack him there. But at that moment news
came that the Romans were marching on Fiesole, so he
was obliged to hasten back there before the siege should
begin. Thus ends the singular episode annexed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
legend, when, having lost its primitive character, it
became a fairy tale while pretending to be history.</p>

<p>Villani, on the other hand, follows a more ancient
compilation, and rejects the Belisca story. He, too, is
acquainted with the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Libro fiesolano</span>," makes some use
of it, but considers it unauthentic exactly at the point
where we find Malespini adhering to it. In fact, when
recording the pretended descent of the Uberti from Catiline,
Villani adds: "We find no proof of these matters
in any authentic <span class="locked">history."<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span> Also, in trying, as far as
possible, to give the legend a more genuine and historical
appearance, he often inserts alterations drawn from the
sources on which the legend itself was based, sometimes
quoting Roman poets and historians such as Ovid, Lucan,
Titus Livy, and, above all, Sallust, to whom he refers
when adding certain historical particulars to the Catiline
legends. A permanently instructive psychological fact is
afforded us by the men of this period, and most of all by
Villani. How was it that a contemporary of Dante&mdash;a
man practised in affairs, cultivated, intellectual, and acutely
observant&mdash;could mingle so much and such puerile credulity
with great intelligence, culture, and common sense?</p>

<p>In short, what substantial information can be gleaned
from the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Chronica de origine civitatis</span>"? Besides
the ambitious aim, common to nearly all the cities of
Italy, of trying to trace their origin back to the Romans
and Trojans, the "Chronica" wishes to impress upon us
that the Etruscan Fiesole was the constant rival of Roman
Florence, which could not prosper until the former was
destroyed. Therefore, Catiline, the enemy of Rome, is
the defender of Fiesole, Cæsar, Augustus, the emperors,
are the founders, champions, and restorers of Florence,
which is always described as being in the likeness of Rome
and styled little Rome, Augusta, Cesarea, &amp;c. Totila or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Attila&mdash;that is, barbarians who overthrew the Empire&mdash;are
likewise destroyers of Florence. Another legend of later
date attributes the rebuilding of the city to Charlemagne,
the restorer of the Empire. So at least the tale runs in
Villani and Malespini; but there is no trace of it either
in the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Origine</span>," or the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Libro fiesolano</span>," both
impregnated with Roman traditions only, and the
legends of chivalry being as yet unknown to Florence.
In fact, Villani remarks, when repeating the tale: "We
find (it) in the 'Chronicles of <span class="locked">France.'"<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span></p>

<p>We may accept as a certainty that the first origin of
Florence was owed to Etruscan Fiesole, and that this was
known even in the days of Dante is proved by his lines
to the Florentines ("Inferno," xv. 61&ndash;3):</p>

<div class="poem-container" xml:lang="it" lang="it">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Ma quell' ingrato popolo maligno,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Che discese da Fiesole ab antico,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E tiene ancor del monte e del macigno."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>And Niccolò Machiavelli, leaving all legends aside (as
Aretino had done before him), justly declared that the
traders of Fiesole had begun from very remote times to
form a commercial settlement on the Arno, at the point
where the Mugnone runs into the river. So gradually
a cluster of cabins arose, grew into houses, and finally
became a rival city. But the city was entirely constructed
by the Romans, though at what precise period is still unascertained.
It is scarcely probable that the event can
have occurred earlier than two centuries before Christ.
Perhaps the city began to rise when, to protect Tuscany
against Ligurian invaders, the Romans made a network of
roads through the valley of the Arno; that is, when
(according to Livy) C. Flaminius <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">viam a Bononia perduxit
Arretium</span></i>, the which road crossed the Ponte Vecchio.
Strabo says nothing of Florence; Tacitus and Pliny are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
the first to mention it. But in the second century of the
Vulgar Era Florius already styles it <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Municipium splendidissimum</span></i>,
and records it among the cities which suffered
most in the days of <span class="locked">Sulla.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> Recent excavations made in
digging new sewers under Florence have furnished proofs
that in Sulla's time the city must have already possessed
buildings of no small importance, including an <span class="locked">amphitheatre.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span>
The restoration of Florence, after the serious
injuries inflicted on it in Sulla's day, is generally attributed
to Augustus, who is supposed to have made it the seat of
one of the twenty-eight colonies founded by him, whence
the name <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Julia, Augusta, Florentia</span></i>. The "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Liber Coloniarum</span>"
(p. 213, 6) numbers Florence among the colonies
formed by the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Triumviri</span></i> (45 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), and it certainly must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
have been a colony in 15 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, when the city sent a deputation
to Tiberius asking him to forbid the junction of
the river Chiana with the Arno, on account of the damage
this would cause (Tacitus, "Ann.," i. 79). But the
weighty authority of Mommsen supports the view that,
in spite of the testimony given by Florius, the colony
of Florence was founded instead by <span class="locked">Sulla.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> The same
date may be assigned to the construction of the oldest
circuit of walls, existing during a great part of the
Middle Ages, and some remains of which have been discovered
in our own day.</p>

<div id="ip_67" class="figcenter" style="width: 393px;">

<p><i>Discovered near the Campidoglio, Florence.</i></p></div>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 66.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>Florence would seem to have been built in the form of the
ancient Roman <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Castrum</span></i>, a quadrangle traversed by two wide
and perfectly straight streets, crossing it in the centre at
right angles and dividing it into quarters. The Campidoglio
stood in the middle on the site afterwards occupied
by the Church of Santa Maria in Campidoglio, and the
Forum was near at hand, on the site of the now demolished
Mercato Vecchio. There was also the amphitheatre,
known in the Middle Ages as the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Parlascio</span></i>, of which
some traces exist near Borgo de' Greci; a theatre (in
Via de' Gondi.); a temple of Isis (on the site of San
Firenze); and baths in the street still known as Via
delle <span class="locked">Terme.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> Accordingly, it is not surprising that the
city, which was then very small and limited to this side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the Arno, should have been called Little Rome, and sought
to base its origin on Roman traditions. The whole
spirit of its monuments spoke of Rome, and the same
spirit was echoed by the minds and imaginations of those
who invented the legend. Even now, after so many centuries,
so many changes, we still find remains of Roman
buildings, and of so-called Byzantine architecture, but no
single trace of the real Gothic or Longobard style.</p>

<p>Florence gradually extended as time went on, and
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">borghi</span></i> were built outside the walls, the largest of these
suburban quarters being the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Borgo</span></i>, connected with the city
proper by the Ponte Vecchio. In the second half of the
eleventh century, and in the year 1078, if Villani's statement
be correct (iv. 8), new walls were built to replace
the palisades surrounding the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Borghi</span></i>. Villani may be
accepted as an authority, now that he is known to have
superintended the construction of the third and last circuit
of walls begun in 1299 (viii. 2 and 31), and now almost
entirely destroyed save for a fragment here and there.</p>

<p>For a long time after the epoch of the barbarian invasions
the history of Florence is involved in great obscurity,
and what little information we have on the subject is either
entirely legendary or jumbled with legends.</p>

<p>In 405 Radagasius led a horde of Goths, mixed with
other tribes, into Tuscany and lay siege to Florence. But
the walls held out until the Roman general Stilicho came
to the rescue, defeated the assailants, and put their leader
to death. The resistance of Florence was greatly magnified,
and Stilicho's victory attributed to a miracle. Tradition
added that the battle having been fought on the 8th
of October, the Feast of Santa Reparata, the Florentines
inaugurated their Pallio races on that day, and founded
the Church of Santa Reparata; but both these events were
of later occurrence. The tradition merely serves to show
how long Florence preserved the memory of its narrow
escape from destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Regarding the next century there is an absolute blank;
but then comes the legend that even Villani accepts,
relating how Totila, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">flagellum Dei</span></i>, destroyed Florence
and re-built <span class="locked">Fiesole.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> To this the chronicler appends a
second tale to the effect that after the city had remained
thus devastated and ruined for 350 years, Charlemagne
summoned the Romans to join him in rebuilding the city in
the likeness of Rome, and that it thus arose anew, adorned
with churches dedicated, like those of Rome, to San Pietro,
San Lorenzo, Santa Maria Maggiore, &amp;c., and was also
granted a territory extending three miles beyond the
<span class="locked">walls.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> Here one sees that although the chronicler had
already recorded, on the authority of the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Origine</span>,"
that Florence was rebuilt immediately after its pretended
destruction by Totila, he thought that date premature,
seeing that Florence really remained for long after in a
very desolate and obscure condition, and therefore, to save
trouble, he also jots down the posterior legend attributing
instead the reconstruction of the city to Charlemagne, the
saviour of the Empire.</p>

<p>What germs of truth can be gleaned from all this?
Totila really entered Tuscany in 542, and sent part of his
host to besiege Florence. Justin, the commander of the
Imperial garrison there, then sought aid from Ravenna;
and when the relieving force approached the city, Totila
raised the siege and withdrew towards Sienna. Pursued
by the Imperial troops, he succeeded in routing them, but
instead of returning against Florence, directed his march
towards Southern Italy. So at least runs the account given
by Procopius, and also followed by modern <span class="locked">writers.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span> The
Goths, it is true, made another descent later, easily mastered
Tuscany and Florence, and committed much cruelty there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
though without destroying the city. These are the facts;
all the rest was a legendary excrescence signifying that the
Florentines endured a long period of obscurity and oppression,
and only began to emerge from it in the time of the
Franks.</p>

<p>In fact, the Longobard occupation of Tuscany took
place towards 570, and we have two centuries of utter
darkness. We find mention of one <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gudibrandus, Dux
civitatis Florentinorum</span></i>, appointed by the conquerors; but
nothing else is known to us. Amid the many calamities
wrought by invasion, war, and harsh tyranny, not only
was the trade, to which Florence owed its existence,
entirely ruined, but many families escaped from the plains
to safe places among the hills, and a good number
accordingly took refuge in Fiesole, which city profited as
usual by the ill fortune of Florence. And this to so great
an extent, that during the latter half of the eighth century
we find documents alluding to Florence as though it had
become a suburb of <span class="locked">Fiesole.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span> But soon, beneath Charlemagne's
rule, times of greater order and tranquillity were
inaugurated. Men began once more to forsake the hills
for the valley; Florence began to prosper at Fiesole's
expense. And as the Franks replaced the Longobard
dukes by counts, so Florence too had its count, exercising
jurisdiction throughout the territories of the bishopric that
had been carved out of the old Roman division. This
was the so-called <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado fiorentino</span></i>, stretching on the one
side to a place called I Confini, near Prato, and thence
towards Poggio a Caiano, sweeping round by the Empoli
district, and conterminous with the borders of Lucca,
Volterra, and the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> of <span class="locked">Fiesole.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span></p>

Charlemagne halted in Florence, and celebrated Christmas
there in 786; he likewise defended the property of
the Florentine Church against Longobard aggressions.
This gave rise to the legend that the rebuilding of the city
was his work. Regardless of anachronisms, Villani not only
adds that many imaginary privileges were conceded by him,
but attributes to this period the birth of the Commune
which only took place several centuries later. "Charles," he
tells us, "created many knights, and granted privileges to
the city by rendering free and independent the Commune,
its inhabitants, and the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, with all dwellers therein,
for three miles round, inclusive of resident strangers from
other parts. For this reason many men returned to the
said city, and framed its government after the Roman
mode, namely, with two consuls and a council of one
hundred <span class="locked">senators."<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> But this addition is made by the
chronicler, and in a more arbitrary way than the legend
itself.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Not Charlemagne only, but likewise
Otho I., the regenerator of the German Empire, must be
necessarily the patron of Florence, "because," continues
the chronicler, "it had always appertained to the Romans
and been faithful to the <span class="locked">Empire."<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> In the year 955 the
emperor halted in Florence on the way to Rome for his
coronation, and on this occasion the chronicler makes him
grant the city a territory of six miles in extent, that is,
one as big again, but no less imaginary, than that bestowed
by Charlemagne. Villani goes on to relate how Otho
established peace in Italy, overthrew tyrants, and left many
of his barons settled in Lombardy and Tuscany, the
Counts Guidi and Uberti among the rest. He fails to
reflect that some of these Tuscan families were of much
earlier origin, and that even in his own day the leading
nobles of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> bore the name of Cattani Lombardi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
in remembrance of their Longobard descent. Also, he
again forgets that Florence was not then a free city to
whom the emperor could concede a portion of territory,
which, as we have seen, already belonged to his own
jurisdiction, and, towards Fiesole at least, could not
possibly be of six miles in <span class="locked">extent.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span></p>

<p>Another fabulous narrative, also given by Villani, is
that of the destruction of Fiesole in 1010. On the day
of St. Romolo's feast the Florentines, bent on revenge,
are supposed to have entered the rival city with arms concealed
under their clothes, and suddenly drawing their
weapons and summoning comrades hidden in ambush, to
have rushed through the streets, seizing everything and
destroying all houses and buildings excepting the bishop's
palace, the cathedral, two or three churches, and the
fortress, which refused to surrender. After this, safety
was promised to all disposed to migrate into Florence, and
many profited by the offer. Thus the two peoples were
made one, and even their flags united. That of the
Florentines bore the white lily on a red field, that of
Fiesole a demi lune azur on a white field; and thus was
formed the red and white banner of the <span class="locked">Commune.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span></p>

<p>According to Villani this union of two separate peoples
proved the chief cause of the continual wars by which
Florence was harassed, together with the fact of the city
being built "under the sway and influence of the planet
Mars, the which always leads to war and discord." Then
again, as though forgetting he had already made the same
statement regarding the times of Charlemagne, he repeats
the almost equal anachronism that the Florentines "then
made common laws and statutes, and lived under the rule
of two consuls and a council of senators, consisting of a
hundred men, the best of the city, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
custom introduced in Florence by the <span class="locked">Romans."<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span> It is
plain that he does not know how the Commune arose, but
feels persuaded its origin was derived from Rome, and
therefore records the fact as having occurred at the moment
suiting him best, or seeming least improbable. But it is
hard to see why he assigned the war and destruction of Fiesole
to the year 1010 when aware that those events occurred,
on the contrary, in 1125, as he afterwards relates in due
place. The most probable explanation is, that finding the
legend gave an account of the war and overthrow of Fiesole
<i>more than five hundred years</i> after the destruction of
Florence by Totila, whose invasion occurred <i>five hundred
years</i> after the city was founded, the chronicler described
the destruction twice over, namely, in 1010 and 1125;
thus following first the legendary account, which had
retraced its steps in a very vague fashion, and next the
historical account, commonly known in his day. As for
the causes of civil war being derived from the forced
junction of two hostile nationalities, it may be observed
that the diversity between the Germanic strain in the
nobility and the Latin blood of the people, really constituted
a strong element of discord, and this may have been
felt, if not understood, by the chronicler.</p>

<p>It is certain that from the Frankish times downward
the prosperity of Florence slowly but surely increased.
Nevertheless it is true that, as Villani says, its whole territory
bristled with the castles of feudal barons of Germanic
descent, all hostile to Florence, and many of whom, safely
ensconced on the neighbouring hill of Fiesole, were always
ready to swoop down on Florentine soil.</p>

<p>In spite of this the geographical position of the city,
on the road to Rome, proved increasingly advantageous
to its commerce. As early as 825 the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Costitutiones
olonenses</span></i> of the Emperor Lothair proposed Florence, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
seven other Italian cities, as the seat of a public school,
thus attesting its importance even at that date. Besides,
the German emperors nearly always halted there on their
way to coronation in Rome. More often, and for longer
periods, the Popes made sojourn there, whenever&mdash;a by
no means uncommon occurrence&mdash;popular disturbances
expelled them from Rome. Victor II. died in Florence
in 1057, and had held a council there two years before;
in 1058 Stephen IX. drew his last breath there; three
years later Nicholas II. and his cardinals stayed in the
town pending the election of Alexander II. Full of
Roman traditions and monuments, in continual relation
with the Eternal City, Florence was subject to its influence
from the earliest times, and showed the Guelph and religious
tendencies afterwards increasingly prominent in the course
of her history. Towards the close of the tenth century
many new churches arose within and without the city
walls. At the beginning of the eleventh century the
construction of an edifice such as San Miniato al Monte, in
addition to the other churches built about the same period,
affords indubitable proof of awakening prosperity and
religious zeal. In fact, Florence now became one of the
chief centres of the movement in favour of monastic
reform that, after its first manifestation at Cluny, spread
so widely on all sides. St. Giovanni Gualberto, of Florentine
birth, who died in 1073, inaugurated the reformed
Benedictine order known by the name of Vallombrosa, in
which place he founded his celebrated cloister, and subjected
many of the monasteries near Florence to the same rule.</p>

<p>(<i>Bas-relief by Benedetto da Rovezzano in the National Museum, Florence.</i>)</p></div>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 74.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>Before long this religious and monastic zeal burnt so
fiercely in Florence, that when its bishop, Pietro da Pavia,
was accused of simony, all the people rose against him.
The friars declared that he owed his high office to the
favour of the emperor, and of Duke Goffredo and
Beatrice his wife, and that he had bought their protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
at a very heavy price. The multitude sided
with the friars, and the quarrel was carried on for five
years (1063&ndash;68), and with so much heat as to lead to
bloodshed. The bishop, enraged by these accusations,
and emboldened by the duke's favour, caused an armed
attack to be made on the monastery of San Salvi near
Florence. The first promoter of the religious movement,
St. Giovanni Gualberto, was, fortunately for him, elsewhere
at the time; but his altars were pillaged and several
of his monks injured. This incident naturally added
fuel to the fire, and St. Giovanni Gualberto, who had
already inflamed men's minds by preaching in the city
streets, now cast aside all reserve, and openly declared that
no priests consecrated by a simoniacal bishop were real
members of the clergy. The popular excitement rose to
so high a pitch, that it is asserted that about a thousand
persons preferred to die unassoiled, rather than receive the
sacrament from priests ordained by a bishop guilty of
<span class="locked">simony.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> Strange though it seem, this was by no means
incredible in times of earnest religious faith!</p>

<p>Pope Alexander II. vainly endeavoured to pacify the
people; vainly sent the pious, learned, and eloquent St.
Pier Damiano to achieve that end. The holy man came
with the words of peace, afterwards repeated in his letters
addressed to <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dilectis in Christo civibus florentinis</span></i>. He
censured simony, but likewise blamed too easy credence
of the charge. It were better, he said, for the Florentines
to send representatives to the Synod in Rome, whose
authority would decide the quarrel; meanwhile they
must remain quiet, without yielding to the blind and
heinous illusion that had left so many to die without the
"sacraments" to their souls' peril. Woe to those who seek
to be juster than the just, wiser than the wise. Through
too great zeal, they end by joining the foes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Church. Croaking even as frogs (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">velut ranae in paludibus</span></i>),
they throw everything into confusion, and may be
likened to the plague of locusts in Egypt, since they
bring equal destruction on the <span class="locked">Church.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span></p>

<p>This movement much resembled that carried on about
the same time by the Patarini in Milan against the
simony of the archbishop. There too, as in Florence,
St. Pier Damiano played the part of peacemaker, and
there also many preferred to die unassoiled, rather than
take the sacrament from simoniacal <span class="locked">priests.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> But, despite
the resemblance of the two insurrections, they led to
different final results, owing to the different conditions of
the two cities, and the very diverse attitude respectively
assumed towards them by the Court of Rome. At any
rate, the exhortations of St. Pier Damiano had no effect
in Florence. The Vallombrosa monks sent representatives
to Rome, but only to declare before the Council, then in
session, their readiness to decide the question by appeal
to the judgment of God. Not only was their proposal
rejected by Pope and Council, but they were also severely
censured for suggesting it, although the Archdeacon
Hildebrand, there present, who had already risen to great
authority in the Church, tried to defend them, as he had
previously defended the Patarini of Milan. The Council
ordered the monks to withdraw to their monasteries, and
abide in them quietly, without daring again to inflame
minds already unduly excited. St. Giovanni Gualberto
would have obeyed willingly now; but it was too late:
he could no longer quell the storm he had raised. For
when the populace heard of what the monks had proposed
in Rome, they insisted on the ordeal by fire. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
champion chosen for the purpose, already prepared and
impatient to stand the test, was a certain Brother Pietro,
of Vallombrosa, afterwards known by the name of Pietro
Igneo, who, according to some writers, had been cowherd
to the monastery, although others assert him to have
belonged to the noble family of the Counts Aldobrandeschi
of Sovana. Guglielmo, surnamed Bulguro, of the
Counts of Borgonuovo, offered the monks a free arena
for the ordeal, close to the Abbey of San Salvatore, in his
patronage, at Settimo, five miles from <span class="locked">Florence.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> The
bishop, however, not only rejected the challenge with
indignation, but obtained a decree to the effect that whoever,
whether of the Church or the laity, should refuse to
obey his authority, the same would be seized, bound, and
<i>not led, but dragged</i> before the chief of the <span class="locked">city.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> Likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the goods of all persons having fled in alarm were to
be confiscated by the <i>Potestà</i>, that is, by Duke Goffredo,
who favoured the bishop. Meanwhile, certain rebellious
ecclesiastics who had sought refuge in an <span class="locked">oratory,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> were
driven from it by force. Naturally, these measures only
increased the heat of the popular fury. Pietro Igneo
declared his readiness to pass through the fire, and, if
need be, alone. On February 13, 1068, an enormous
crowd of men, women (some about to be mothers), old
people, and children, set forth to Settimo, chanting prayers
and psalms by the way. There, by the Badia, two piles
of wood were fired, and, as related by one who claims to
have witnessed the sight, the friar passed through the
roaring flames miraculously unhurt. This aroused an
indescribable enthusiasm; the sky echoed with cries of
joy, and Pietro Igneo, though unscathed by the fire, was
nearly crushed to death by the throng pressing round him
to kiss the hem of his robe. With great difficulty, and
only by main force, some ecclesiastics succeeded in rescuing
<span class="locked">him.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> The news flew to Rome with lightning speed,
and then, when all the details reached the Pope's ear, he
was compelled to bow to the miracle. The bishop of
Florence retired to a monastery; Pietro Igneo was named
cardinal, made bishop of Albano, and worshipped as a
saint after his death.</p>

<p>This reminds us of the other ordeal by fire proposed in
Florence in 1498, and that led to Savonarola's martyrdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
shortly before the fall of the Republic, of which the birth
and death would thus seem to have been preluded by
similar events. For, albeit the account of the affair may
have been exaggerated by party feeling and superstition,
and although the terms of "Preside" and "Podestà"
employed in the old narrative only indicate in a general
way the ruling powers in Florence at the time, all
shows that a new state of society had begun. We
find that there was a Duke of Tuscany, a military
president, apparently his representative in the city, and,
what is more, a people which, though only appearing
as a fanatic mob, is plainly conscious at last of its
own strength, since it struggles against the bishop,
resists both the duke and the Pope, and finally obtains
what it desires. In addressing the Pope it assumes
the title of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">populus florentinus</span></i>; and is addressed
by St. Pier Damiano as <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">cives florentini</span></i>. It is true, of
course, that these were mere forms of speech imitated from
the ancients; assuredly the Commune was still unborn,
and much time had yet to elapse before its rise; but an
entirely new condition of things had begun, in which the
elements conducing to its rise were already in course of
preparation. Accordingly, we must now retrace our steps,
in order to study the question more closely.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div><img src="images/i_w.jpg" class="drop-capi" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-capiw"><span class="smcap">WHEN</span> the Longobards became masters of
nearly the whole of Italy, and subjected
it to their long and cruel sway, they are
known to have appointed a duke to
every one of the principal cities they
occupied. Rome remained free from
them, having a Pope; Ravenna also escaped because
an Exarch was soon to hold rule there, and almost
all the cities by the sea were likewise exempted, inasmuch
as the Longobards were ignorant of navigation,
and needed assistance for their maritime trade. It was
for the same reason that republics such as Venice, Amalfi,
Pisa, Naples, and Gaeta, were of earlier origin than the
rest. The dukes enjoyed great authority and independence;
indeed, some of the duchies, especially on the borders,
became so extended as to resemble small kingdoms&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
the dukedoms of Friuli, Spoleto, and Benevento. This
circumstance greatly contributed to the decomposition of
the kingdom and to the fall of the Longobards, whose
strength and daring were never conjoined with any real
political capacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
On the arrival of the Franks, counts took the place of
dukes, but with less power and smaller territories. Charlemagne,
with his genuine talent for statesmanship, refused
to maintain lords who, in seeking their own independence,
might endanger the existence of his empire. Nevertheless,
as it was indispensable to keep his borders more
strongly defended, he constituted <i>marches</i>, on the pattern
of the greater Longobard duchies, and entrusted them to
margraves, or marquises (<i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Mark-grafen</span></i>&mdash;frontier counts,
marquises, or margraves). Thus too the marquisate of
Tuscany was formed and the government centred in Lucca;
for this city having had a duke of its own ever since the
times of the Longobards, was already of considerable importance,
while, as we have seen, Florence had fallen so
low that the documents of the period merely refer to it
as a suburb of Fiesole. Nearly all the margraves acquired
great power, and aspired to still higher dignities. From
their ranks in fact came men such as Hardouin and Berengarius,
who, aspiring to form an Italian kingdom, became
formidable opponents of the Empire, often wrought it
much harm, and involved it in sanguinary wars.</p>

<p>Hence it is not surprising if, later on, the policy of
the German emperors should have constantly aimed at the
enfeeblement of the leading Italian counts and margraves,
and, by granting exemptions and benefices to prelates
or lesser feudatories, and making all benefices conceded to
the latter hereditary estates, rendered these independent of
all greater and more dangerous potentates. Therefore,
particularly in Lombardy, this class rose to importance,
and so, too, the political authority of the bishops, who in
point of fact held the position of counts. But in Tuscany
things took a different turn. Whether feudalism there,
having smaller strength and power of expansion, seemed
less formidable to the Empire; whether the country, being
more distant, proved less easy to govern; or because a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
strong state in central Italy was felt to be needed to arrest
the growing power of the Papacy; whether the latter may
have favoured its formation, as a possible check to the
Empire; or again, as seems probable, for all these reasons
combined, it is certain that the dukes or marquises of
Tuscany (either title was borne by them) increased in
power and consequence, and afterwards, in their turn,
became a danger to the Empire. But in Tuscany the
power of bishops and counts suffered more reduction than
in Lombardy from the growing strength of the margraves,
whose sway was extending on all sides, so that they sometimes
appear to be virtual sovereigns of central Italy. The
same reasons served to delay the rise of cities, and specially
hindered that of Florence.</p>

<p>Already, from the second part of the tenth century, a
Marquis Ugo, surnamed the Great, of Salic descent,
ruled over Tuscany, the duchy of Spoleto and the <i>march</i>
of Camerino. He reigned in Lucca almost in the guise of
an independent monarch, and enjoyed the favour of the
Othos. His successors continued to govern with much
the same authority as the dukes of Benevento; and Bonifazio
III. extended his State even to Northern Italy, thus
giving umbrage to Henry III., whom he often outrivalled
in cunning. Bonifazio being voracious for power, and of
tyrannical temper, stripped many prelates, counts, and
monasteries of their possessions, either to seize them in
his own grasp or give them to better trusted vassals. He
also tightened his grasp on all cities which, having risen
to some importance, coveted increased freedom. This
was specially the case with Lucca and Pisa. The former
had prospered through being long the chief seat of the
duchy, while the latter owed its prosperity to the sea, on
which, as Amari happily phrased it, Pisa was already a
free city, while still a subject city on land. Florence,
however, still existed in humble obscurity, trading in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
a small way, and girt about on all sides by feudal
strongholds.</p>

<p>In 1037 Bonifazio had taken to wife Beatrice of Lorraine,
who in 1046 gave birth to a daughter, Matilda, the
celebrated countess or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">comitissa</span></i>, as she is entitled by the
chroniclers. After the death of Bonifazio, by assassination,
in 1052, Matilda was soon associated with her mother in
the government of Tuscany and of the whole duchy, and
when left an orphan in 1076, became sole ruler of those
extensive dominions. Beatrice had remarried, and as she
was very religious, and her second husband, Goffredo of
Lorraine, was brother to Pope Stephen IX., this served to
increase their common zeal for the papal policy, afterwards
so devotedly pursued by Matilda. When this high-minded,
energetic woman became sole ruler, she held the
reins of government in a firm grasp, and was often seen
on battle-fields with a sword at her side. Her political
position was one of great peril, for she was driven to
take part in the fierce quarrel, recently begun, between
the Church and the Empire. At first the great, high-tempered
Hildebrand conducted the struggle as the
inspiring genius of various Popes; later on, when raised
to the pontifical Chair as Gregory VII., he fought in
person against Henry IV. of Germany, and found Matilda
his strongest and best ally. In this conflict, stirring and
dividing all Europe, it was only natural that many
opposing passions should be excited in Italy. All cities
that, like Pisa and Lucca, considered themselves wronged
by Duke Bonifazio, now declared for the Empire, and
the Empire sided with them against Matilda. The same
course was followed by all dissatisfied feudatories, especially
by those whom Bonifazio had stripped of their
possessions. More than once, it is true, Countess Matilda
seized estates which had been arbitrarily alienated; but
she seldom restored them to their original owners, preferring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
instead to bestow them on churches, convents, and
trusty adherents of her own. This added fresh fuel to
the flame. Hence an increasingly tangled web of
opposing passions, of conflicting interests, from which at
last some profit accrued to Florence. The Guelph spirit
of the city and its commercial position, on the highway
to Rome, had from the outset inclined it to the Church,
and now, as a declared ally, was actively favoured by
Beatrice and Matilda.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It was long believed that Florence had had Consuls, and
consequently an independent government, from the year
1102, since Consuls are mentioned in a treaty of that date,
whereby the inhabitants of Pogna swore submission to the
city. But it was difficult to reconcile this fact with the
clearly proved dependence of Florence on Countess Matilda
at the time. It was afterwards ascertained that the document
in question bore a wrong date, and that the correct
one was 1182, when the submission of Pogna really took
place. Accordingly, the independence of the city was
transferred to after 1115, the year of the countess's death.
But it was still difficult to explain the wars previously
carried on by the city on its own account, and other events
of a like nature. The fact is that no fixed year can be
assigned to the birth of the Florentine Commune, which
took shape very slowly, and resulted from the conditions
of Florence under the rule of the last dukes or marquises.
We have already recorded the popular riots of 1063&ndash;68
against the bishop Mezzabarba, when accused of simony,
and we have related how they ended with the ordeal of
fire, braved by Pietro Igneo in 1068. On this head we
have cited the letters of St. Pier Damiano addressed <i>civibus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
florentinis</i>. We also referred to a <span class="locked">document<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> in
which the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">clerus et populus florentinus</span></i> made appeal to
the Pope, and, in narrating what had occurred, mentioned
a <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">municipale praesidium</span></i>, a <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">praeses</span></i> of the city, and a
superior <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">potestas</span></i>. This proved, before all, that the civic
body of the period was already conscious of its personality,
and that there was already an embryo local government
within the city walls. Doubtless the supreme <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">potestas</span></i>
was the Duke Goffredo, husband to Beatrice; the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">praeses</span></i>,
his representative in Florence. It was before him that,
as we have seen, the bishop threatened to drag his adversaries,
whose property was to be confiscated should they
persist in disobedience. This <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">preside</span></i> commanded the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">praesidium</span></i>, designated <i>municipal</i> even before the municipality
had come into being, and at least the name shows
that the majority of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">praesidium</span></i> must have consisted
of citizens. But all this makes it equally plain that,
while Florence was still an integral part of the margraviate,
Roman forms, traditions, and ideas already prevailed
there to the extent of assigning Roman names to institutions
of feudal origin. We must pause to consider this
fact, since it gave rise to a question, not only of form, but
of genuine historical importance.</p>

<p>The employment of Roman terms need cause little surprise
when we remember that the study of elementary
Roman law, as well as of <span class="locked">rhetoric,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ars dictandi</span></i> then
formed part of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Trivium</span></i>, and was therefore widely
taught in Italy. In the first half of the eleventh century
a still more advanced study of law already flourished at
the school of Ravenna, and as its influence increased,
extended through Romagna into Tuscany. This system
of law seemed to spring to life again spontaneously from
the midst of Latin populations, with whom it had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
entirely died out, and now in its new vigour brought
modifications and changes into the different institutions
and legislations with which it came in <span class="locked">contact.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> In fact,
in the sentences pronounced by Beatrice and Matilda, we
find occasional quotations from the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Digesto</span></i>, or Code, that,
according to the procedure of the time, was carried to the
tribunals by those basing their rights on its <span class="locked">clauses.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> The
works of St. Pier Damiano afford satisfactory proof that
the Florentines pursued the same study, and set great
value on Roman law. The saint mentions a juridical dispute
of the Florentines, regarding which, towards the
middle of the eleventh century, they had asked the
opinion of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sapientes</span></i> of Ravenna, who, much to his
own disgust, presumed to alter the prescriptions of canonical
law on the authority of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Digesto</span></i>. Among those
wise men, he adds, the most impetuous and subtle
chanced to be a <span class="locked">Florentine.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span> Another proof might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
deduced from the remark previously made by <span class="locked">Ficker,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span>
namely, that the courts held in Florence and its territory
were seldom attended by the Romagnol assessors, or
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">causidici</span></i>, frequenting other Tuscan tribunals. This
would seem to imply that in this respect Florentines had
no need to recur to Romagna. Later&mdash;that is towards
the end of the century&mdash;the school of Irnerius (Werner)
began to flourish at Bologna, the which school aimed at
an exact reproduction of Roman law and promoted its
genuine revival. But at the time of which we speak the
Ravenna school represented, on the contrary, a continuation
of the ancient jurisprudence, partly decayed and
partly changed by the diverse elements of civilisation in
the midst of which it had survived, and in which it was
now producing radical <span class="locked">changes.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> One of these changes&mdash;leading
to very remarkable consequences of a political as
well as a legal kind&mdash;took place in the constitution and
attributes of the margravial tribunal.</p>

<p>We know that Matilda, after the fashion of her predecessors,
administered justice in the name of the Empire,
presiding in state over the tribunals. Indeed, this was
one of her chief functions. Some sentences given by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
have survived, and serve to show us how her tribunal was
composed. Certain high feudatories had seats flanking
her throne; next came the judges, assessors, pleaders
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">causidici</span></i>), and witnesses, and lastly, the notary. Prof.
Lami has observed that the judges, and more particularly
the assessors, were changed as the countess moved
from city to city, which would prove that not a few of
them were inhabitants of the towns wherein they administered
<span class="locked">justice.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span> In fact, what names do we find among
them in Florence? Those of the Gherardi, Caponsacchi,
Uberti, Donati, Ughi, and a few <span class="locked">others.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> These were
already the first and most influential citizens, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">boni
homines</span></i>, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sapientes</span></i>, the men we afterwards find officiating
as Consuls. Thus there were certain families who
first formed part of the margravial tribunal, and were
afterwards at the head of the Commune.</p>

<p>Political changes were facilitated and prepared by a
juridical change, followed by the increased action of the
revived Roman law. What was the nature of this
change? The exact definition of the functions respectively
assigned by the Germanic code to the president of
the tribunal who gave sentence, or to the judges who led
up to the same by administering the law, had been
gradually lost sight of. Sometimes the countess pronounced
sentence without the aid of judges; but more
often they conducted the trial, applied the law, and formulated
the verdict, to which the countess merely gave
assent. Thus, as Ficker states, her office was reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
to that of a passive <span class="locked">president.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span> This is confirmed on seeing
that tribunals sometimes sat in her absence, when the trials
were entirely managed by the judges. A method of this
kind once adopted, Matilda's grave and numerous affairs
of State, together with the continual warfare in which she
was involved, must have augmented the number of the
cases settled by local judges. This must have been a
matter of weighty importance at a time when the administration
of justice was one of the principal attributes of
political sovereignty. Hence these citizen tribunals are
a precursory sign of civic independence before the Commune
had asserted its real autonomy and individual
position. The strange dearth of documents certifying
that any tribunal in Florence was presided over by
Matilda during the last fifteen years of her life, serves to
confirm our remarks. A similar fact is also verified in
the Tuscan cities remaining faithful to the Empire; for
these too had tribunals in which justice was administered,
not by feudal potentates, but by citizens invested by the
emperor with judicial <span class="locked">authority.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> These, too, served as a
preliminary to communal independence, although hardly
forming, as some thought, its actual beginning.</p>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 89.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>It is certain that in this and other ways, during the
contest between Henry IV. and Matilda, many Tuscan
cities, siding either with the Empire or the Church, and
therefore highly favoured by the one or the other, were
able to achieve a commencement of freedom. After
Henry IV. had defeated Matilda near Mantua in 1081 he
granted large privileges to Pisa and Lucca, in return for
their proofs of goodwill to his cause. In a letter patent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
issued at Rome June 23, 1081, he not only guaranteed
to Lucca the integrity of its walls, but also authorised
it to forbid the construction of any castles in the city or
territory within a circuit of six miles, and promised to
exempt it from building an Imperial palace. He likewise
declared that no Imperial envoy should be sent to give
judgment in Lucca, but made a reservation in case of the
personal presence there of the emperor, or his son, or his
chancellor. In conclusion, he annulled the "evil
customs" (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">perverse consuetudini</span></i>) imposed by Bonifazio
<span class="locked">III.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span> to the hurt of Lucca, and granted it full permission
to trade in the markets of San Donnino and Capannori,
from which he expressly excluded the Florentines. This
final clause not only proves the hostility of the Empire to
Florence, but the importance the latter's trade must have
assumed by that time. In the same year Pisa received a
patent guaranteeing the maintenance of its ancient rights,
and Henry declared that no Imperial envoy belonging to
another territory should be sent to plead suits within the
walls, or within the boundaries of its <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>. And,
what was still more to the point, he also declared that no
marquis should be sent into Tuscany without the consent
of twelve <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">buoni uomini</span></i> chosen by the popular assembly,
summoned in Pisa by sound of <span class="locked">bell.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> Here, if no Consuls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
yet appear on the scene, we already find their precursors
in these worthies, or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sapientes</span></i>, elected of the people, and
we have already a popular assembly. Even though the
Commune be still unborn, its birth is now, as it were,
in sight. Further (provided nothing was interpolated in
the document), it is most remarkable to find the appointment
of an Imperial margrave subject to the sanction of
the people. There is also a hinted desire&mdash;unattainable
during Matilda's life&mdash;to assume the government of the
margraviate in person; after her death an attempt to
this effect was actually made, but, as we shall see, with
very brief and partial success.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Nevertheless the condition of Florence was considerably
different from that of Pisa or Lucca. These two cities,
as we have seen, had long enjoyed greater prosperity.
They had often fought against each other; Pisa, haughty
and daring by sea, had begun, even in the middle of
the tenth century, a long and arduous war against the
<span class="locked">Mussulmans<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span> of Sicily, Spain, and Africa. Florence, on
the other hand, in siding with Matilda, became necessarily
the foe of all the great feudal nobles of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>,
surrounding the city on all sides, and who, disgusted
by their treatment at the hands of the marquises of Tuscany,
since the time of Bonifazio III., now, for the most
part, adhered to the Empire. Their antagonism towards
the Florentines was not only heightened by the fact
of these nobles being of Germanic origin, even as feudal
institutions were Germanic, whereas the population of
Florence, consisting chiefly of artisans, was of Roman
origin and full of Roman traditions; but it was likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
increased by the geographical position of the city. Had
Florence been situated in a plain like Pisa and Lucca, or
like Sienna and Arezzo on a height, the feudal nobility
could have promoted their interests better by settling
within its walls. But it lay in a valley in the midst of
a girdle of hills bristling with feudal turrets, whence the
nobles threatened it on all sides, raiding its lands and
closing all outlets for its commerce.</p>

<p>These geographical conditions had no slight effect on
the future destiny of Florence; and, in fact, largely contributed
to form the special character of its history. As
a primary result, conflict between the feudal nobles and
the city was more inevitable and more sanguinary than
elsewhere, while the city being, from the first, of far
more democratic temper than the rest, was therefore
longer prevented from asserting its independence, since
this result could only be achieved when Florence had
gained sufficient strength to cope with the numerous
enemies girding it about. Until that moment arrived its
interests were best forwarded by remaining friendly and
submissive to Countess Matilda, the only power able to
hold the barons in check, and the loss of whose aid would
have left Florence a prey to its foes. This explains not
only the city's delay in asserting its independence, but
also the total lack of documents concerning the origin of
a commune that had already risen to considerable strength,
and started wars on its own account before its existence
was officially recognised. These wars were still carried
on in the name of the Countess, who occasionally visited
the camp in person; the city was unmentioned in public
documents, because it had as yet no personal existence.
Nevertheless, we are forced to recognise the first signs
of its communal life in the campaigns undertaken by
Florence in defence of its trade against the nobles of
the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>; the which campaigns were continued on an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
increasing and more vigorous scale until they ended in
the total annihilation of the feudal lords. This was both
the starting point and the aim of all Florentine history.</p>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 96.</i>
</p></div>

<p>From the very beginning, it is true, we find that even
Florence possessed some families that may be called noble.
Such were the Donati, Caponsacchi, Uberti, Lamberti,
and others whose names were included on the lists of the
judges and soon to be found on those of the Consuls.
These were the ruling, governing families at the head of
the city. But they were neither counts, marquises, nor
dukes; they were not as the Counts Cadolingi, Guidi,
and Alberti, who dwelt in the outlying territory or
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>; nor did they belong to those <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Cattani Lombardi</span></i>
so-called at the time, in remembrance of their Germanic
descent. Rather than veritable nobles, they were
"worthies" (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">boni homines</span></i>), "great ones" (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>),<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> owning
no feudal titles; natives of the city risen to high
fortune, or scions of petty feudal lines, who, unable to
hold their own against greater neighbours of the country
side, had sought safety within the town. They quickly
amalgamated with the people, sharing and taking the
lead in all the latter's expeditions against the strongholds
outside the city. Nor, as will be shown, was it a rare
case, later on, to find some of these nobles engaged in
trade, or heads of trade guilds, as soon as the latter
became more firmly established. And it is by no means
an insignificant fact that during disturbances at Pisa,
Sienna, and elsewhere, we often see the names of real
citizen-nobles, counts, viscounts, and so on, never to be
met with in Florence. In documents concerning the
Florentines the word <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">nobiles</span></i> seldom occurs, whereas it
is often used in speaking of the Pisans, Siennese, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
The term <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">milites</span></i>, it is true, frequently occurs in
Florentine records; but although the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">milites</span></i> could not
be <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i>, since the lower classes were not then admitted
to knighthood, neither could they be feudal nobles in
Florence: they were the leading citizens who exercised no
trade, the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>, in fact, to whom we have previously
alluded. They were members of Matilda's courts, were
employed by her in various ways; they commanded the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">municipale praesidium</span></i>, probably filled the office of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">praeses</span></i>,
and they were leaders of the army. Richer, more cultivated
and better fitted than other citizens for politics and
warfare by their freedom from daily toil, they were the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">boni viri</span></i>, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sapientes</span></i>, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">milites</span></i> found more or less
in all cities, but of a separate stamp in Florence.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding our knowledge of this <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">preside</span></i> and
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">presidio</span></i> and of these Florentine tribunals, very little is
known as to the government and administration of the
social body already beginning to prosper and to have
varied interests of its own. Matilda's sway in Florence
must have been of a shadowy kind, when the city was
able to start wars on its own account and to its own
profit, albeit still undertaken in her name. As its commercial
prosperity increased and Matilda became more
absorbed in her struggle with the Empire, the city must
have been left more to itself. Consequently this is
the time when the associations serving to classify and
organise the citizens were formed, which we presently
find flourishing and strongly established. Thus, being
almost without a central government, a local one could
assert its existence, and the strength of the Commune
be developed long before its independence was proclaimed.
The same fact explains why the Commune, its
individuality once declared, should have made such rapid
progress and leapt to the headship of Tuscany. At any
rate, by the second half of the twelfth century we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
on the one side the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>, or nobles&mdash;if we prefer to
give them that name&mdash;formed in Societies of Towers
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Società delle torri</span></i>), with statutes soon to be made known
to us; while, on the other we find trade guilds or
associations not only in existence, but sometimes with
sufficient political importance to entitle them to the
honour of representing the Republic. Can we possibly
suppose that such results could be achieved without a
long, preliminary course of preparation? Did not the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">scholae</span></i>, progenitors of the guilds, survive during the
Lower Empire and throughout the Middle Ages? do
we not find them dividing all society, including both
the soldiery and foreigners in Rome and in Ravenna?
How could they be destroyed by barbarians ignorant of
crafts which were nevertheless indispensable to their
own needs?</p>

<p>Florentine commerce and industry undoubtedly increased
during the rule of Countess Matilda. This has
been proved by the patent of 1081, and the first wars
undertaken by the Florentines in the interest of their
trade afford sure confirmation of the fact. Were we
to exclude trade associations from the conditions of the
period, we should have to admit the existence, at that
day, of the modern workman, isolated and independent:
a decided impossibility in the Middle Ages. Those were
times in which every trade was exercised by distinct
groups of families, and handed down by them as a
tradition from father to son. Frequently, even offices of
the State were the monopoly of certain families. It was
from a society split into groups and castes that the
Commune eventually developed the modern State, but in
old times the very idea of the latter was unconceived.
It is absurd to suppose&mdash;though a few writers accept the
notion&mdash;that the guilds only began when they had regular
statutes. These statutes only formulated what had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
existed for some time, and undoubtedly in Florence everything
conduces to the belief that the associations of the
trades and of the towers, though still embryonic, must
have preceded the formation of the Commune evolved
in their midst.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>For on all sides, if in diverse modes, we perceive that
a long period of incubation was needed to form the
Commune, which naturally owed its birth to pre-existing
elements. The celebrated agreement or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">concordia</span></i> made
at Pisa by Bishop Daiberto, about 1090, or even, perhaps,
a year or so <span class="locked">earlier,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> shows that the nobles were
organised and waging fierce war against one another
from their towers. The bishop induced them to partly
demolish these towers, and solemnly vow never to carry
them above the height of thirty-six braccia (about one
hundred feet), as previously decreed by the patent of
Henry IV. in <span class="locked">1081.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> And the agreement proceeded
to set forth that any man believing his houses to have
been unjustly damaged was to bear his complaint <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad
commune Colloquium Civitatis</span></i>; nor could the dwelling of
the offender be demolished without the general consent
of the <span class="locked">citizens.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span></p>

<p>The whole tenor of this document not only proves that
the Pisan nobles were already an organised body, but that
they also boasted a civic importance never attained by the
nobles of <span class="locked">Florence.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> Evidently Pisa had no Consuls as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
yet, or they would have been certainly mentioned in the
document. But all the elements destined to make it a
far more aristocratic commune than that of Florence were
already <span class="locked">existent.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> We see that there was a <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">commune
consilium</span></i> of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sapientes</span></i> or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">boni homines</span></i>, which was a
species of senate, and a <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">commune colloquium</span></i>, a general
assembly of all the citizens, afterwards developing into
a parliament or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">arrengo</span></i>. Five <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sapientes</span></i>, whose names
are given, sat in council with the <span class="locked">bishop.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span> These were
the immediate precursors or, as Pawinski rightly calls
them, the <i><span xml:lang="de" lang="de">vorbilder</span></i> of the Consuls, who are actually
mentioned shortly after this time, in 1094, in another
agreement (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">concordia</span></i>), also drawn up by Daiberto. He
makes an explicit appeal to their authority (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">huius civitatis
consulibus</span></i>) in decreeing that all smiths engaged on work
required for the Duomo should be left <span class="locked">unmolested.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span> Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the rise of the Pisan Commune was preceded by a conflict
waged by belligerent nobles from their respective towers,
and the Consuls of the town were first named as the
protectors of the smiths.</p>

<p>The existence of guilds in Venice as far back as the
ninth century is certified by the Altino Chronicle, proving
that, even then, there were some leading industries exercised
by certain families only, and that humbler trades,
or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ministeria</span></i>, were already constituted, as it were, in
associations, the members of which pursued their avocation
according to traditional and definite rules. These
craft-guilds or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ministeria</span></i> implied certain accompanying
obligations, since all members of them were bound to
yield some gratuitous service to the State. On the other
hand, the higher trades, such as mosaic work, architecture,
and so on, requiring more culture and talent, were exercised
by the leading families, and members of these guilds
remained eligible for the political offices of the <span class="locked">State.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
There is a document of the eleventh century showing
that the guild of smiths was constituted under the rule of
a <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">gastaldo</span></i> (or steward), against whom one of the members
appealed for justice to the doge, according to a custom as
yet <span class="locked">unwritten.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> All this compels us to believe that the
existence of art and trade guilds, and in general of all the
associations into which the citizens of the communes were
afterwards divided, dates from a very remote period, and
that in Florence, as elsewhere, all similar associations
were constituted before the Commune had proclaimed its
independence. Otherwise it would be impossible to
explain the existence of a city that, almost without any
visible government, was already prosperous in commerce
and able to make war on its own account. For otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
all the ensuing facts, although beyond the reach of doubt,
would remain unexplained.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Therefore, even in the days of Countess Matilda, we
find the mass of the citizens divided and arranged in
groups. We see on the one side the ancient <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">scholae</span></i>
transformed into associations of arts and trades, containing
the germ of future greater and lesser guilds; on the other,
family associations and clans of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> or leading
citizens, embryos of future societies of the towers. All
these associations already formed the practical government
of the city, in which the principal offices were filled by
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> of Matilda's choice. It is quite probable that
the post of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">preside</span></i> was reserved, in accordance with
mediæval usage, to a single family or clan, perhaps to
that of the Uberti, who were, as we shall see, among the
most powerful in the city, and boasting a Germanic
descent. Nevertheless, there was then no hostility, no
separation between the great folk or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> and the
people, all being united by common bonds and interests.
In fact, as we have said, there will be soon documentary
evidence that some of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> engaged in commerce
were chiefs of guilds, and already beginning to fight, side
by side with the people, against the outlying nobility.
It is true that they owned lands and herds, but these were
then the main source of that Florentine trade and commerce
in defence of which the first wars were undertaken.
The castles surrounding the city barred all outlets for
commerce; armed men were always swooping down from
them to attack and maltreat all pack trains issuing from
the city to convey its products and merchandise to neighbouring
towns. With continual wars on her hands, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Countess Matilda could seldom afford any help, and
consequently the Florentines, although fighting in her
name, were practically left to their own resources. It was
this alliance of all classes of citizens, united by identity
of interests and singleness of purpose against a common
foe, that then constituted the strength of that Florentine
people whose loyalty, purity, and valour were so fervently
praised by Dante and the chroniclers. This was the
moment when virtue laid the foundations of the Commune's
future freedom and wealth.</p>

<p>Villani is given to exaggerate, but there is a basis of
truth in his words when he states in the year 1107 (iv.
25) that "the city being much risen and increased in
population, men, and power, the Florentines determined
to extend their outlying <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, and widen their authority,
and that war should be waged against any castle refusing
obedience." This year, in fact, they began military
operations by attacking the fortress of Monte Orlando,
near Lastra a Signa, also described by the chroniclers as
the castle of Gangalandi or Gualandi, a fief of the Counts
<span class="locked">Cadolingi,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span> then a very powerful family, and soon becoming
bitterly hostile to Florence. During the same year
they captured and demolished the stronghold of Prato,
owned by the Counts Alberti, also very formidable
enemies. But as on this occasion the Countess was
present in the camp, their success is more easily <span class="locked">explained.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
In 1110 we hear of another war. "Florentini iuxsta
Pesa comites vicerunt," we read in the "Annales," i.
which start with this event and date it the 26th of May.
The <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">comites</span></i> here mentioned cannot be the Counts Guidi,
then on friendly terms with Matilda and Florence, although,
when fighting against both at a much later date, they
were specially designated as "The Counts." In 1110
Florence attacked and conquered the Cadolingi, also
known as the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Cattani Lombardi</span></i>, whose lands extended
from Pistoia, by the Val di Nievole, towards Lucca, and
by the Lower Val d'Arno to the vicinity of Florence. If
the city could rout these nobles, it must have acquired
great strength, even admitting the probability that on
this occasion also it had the aid of Matilda's troops.</p>

<p>In 1113 there were two other military campaigns
which, owing to the very different accounts narrated by
the chroniclers, have given rise to an infinity of learned
disputes. First of all came the assault and destruction of
Monte Cascioli, assigned by some to the year 1113, by
others to 1114, and postponed by a few to 1119, when it
was supposed to have been defended by an Imperial
German vicar named Rempoctus or Rabodo, who perished
in the fight. Other chroniclers assign the overthrow of
the castle to three different years, and Villani puts a
climax to the confusion by jumbling together the various
assaults described, assigning them all to 1113, and saying
that the castle had revolted against Robert the German,
vicar of the Empire, holding residence at San Miniato al
Tedesco (iv. 29). But in 1113&mdash;that is, before the
Countess's death&mdash;there was no Imperial vicar in Tuscany,
and consequently none could be installed at San Miniato,
to which the appellation "al Tedesco" was not yet
applied. But the confusion can be cleared, the chroniclers
made to agree, and the different narratives easily explained,
if it is admitted that only the first attack upon Monte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Cascioli took place in 1113, when the castle was held by
the Cadolingi and could be vigorously <span class="locked">defended.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> As
the walls on that occasion were only partially destroyed, it
was necessary to renew the assault in 1114, when they
were totally demolished. They were afterwards rebuilt
by the Cadolingi, and therefore, in 1119, when Florence
had achieved independence, two more attempts were made
to capture the stronghold; the Imperial envoy was killed
while assisting in its defence, and the building was finally
demolished and burnt to the ground. But without anticipating
events we may conclude that even before
Matilda's death the Florentines had succeeded, by their
expeditions against Monte Orlando, Prato, Val di Pesa,
and Monte Cascioli, in opening the highways of Signa,
Prato, and Val d'Elsa to their trade.</p>

<p>Another event, likewise occurring in the years 1113&ndash;15,
although dated by the chroniclers in 1117, namely, the
Pisan expedition to the Balearic Isles, also led to a somewhat
complicated dispute. As already related, the Pisans
began to make war on the Mussulmans from the middle
of the tenth century, and during the latter half of the
next century the strife was pursued more hotly than ever.
In 1087 Pisa and Genoa combined, displayed a fleet of
forty sail in battle array before Mehdia, and in 1113 both
cities joined in the more important expedition to the
Balearic Isles. They were also accompanied by many
counts and marquises from Lombardy and Central Italy,
likewise including a few from the Florentine territory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
Then, combining with the Counts of Barcelona and
Montpellier, the Viscount of Narbonne, and others, they
attacked the Balearic Isles, and, in spite of a very obstinate
resistance, seized the castle of Majorca, and captured
young Burabe, the last scion of the ruling dynasty there.
Villani, in alluding to this war of 1113&ndash;15, assigns it,
like the other chroniclers, to the year 1117, adding that
the Pisans fearing, when about to set sail, that the
Lucchese might, as once before, take advantage of their
absence to attack their city, entrusted the Florentines
with its defence. The latter immediately encamped two
miles from the walls and forbade their men to enter Pisa,
under penalty of death; for, seeing that scarcely any males
were left in the city, they feared some attempts might be
made on the honour of its women, to the grave discredit
of Florentine loyalty. And this decree was rigorously
enforced. One soldier who dared to violate the rules of
discipline was condemned to death, notwithstanding the
prayers of the Pisans, who, as the only chance of saving
the man's life, protested that they could not permit a
capital sentence to be executed on their territory. Whereupon
the Florentines, showing even in this matter their
scrupulous regard for others' rights, purchased a scrap of
land, and there put the culprit to death.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Pisans returning from Majorca, laden
with spoil, offered in token of gratitude to their faithful
friends the choice of accepting either two bronze doors
or two porphyry columns. The Florentines preferred the
latter. The columns were consigned to them wrapped in
scarlet cloth, in token of their value, and now stand in
the chief portal of San Giovanni. However, when the
cloth was stripped off, it was seen that some envious
person had injured the columns with fire. Evidently part
of this account is legendary, and we also discern that
something must have been added to it afterwards, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Pisa and Florence were separated by long and inextinguishable
<span class="locked">animosity.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span></p>

<p>But the wrong date repeated in Villani and many other
chroniclers, regarding a war that lasted several years, and was
apparently only recommenced in 1117, does not justify us
in denying a fact so constantly affirmed by many <span class="locked">writers.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
The Balearic expedition certainly took place, and there is
equal certainty that it was led by the Pisans, with the help
of various friends and allies. Their fear lest the city
should be attacked by the Lucchese in their absence was
justified by the fact that this had really happened in
former times. The Pisans were now foes of Lucca and
friends of Florence, whose loyalty during that early period
was very generally recognised. Why should it be incredible
that these friendly Pisans should have entrusted
the city to their care, or that they should have proved
worthy of the confidence reposed in them? Paolino
Pieri not only repeats the story as told by all the other
chroniclers, but also adds that the bit of ground upon
which the guilty soldier was executed had been purchased
with the help of Bello the Syndic, and that even in his
own day he saw that it was still left uncultivated in
memory of the deed: "it was on the fourth day of July,
three hundred and two years more than one thousand,
when I saw that ground untouched." At any rate, this
is a proof that the tradition of the fact still survived in
the fourteenth century, and that every one had the fullest
belief in it.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The death of Countess Matilda, in 1115, was followed
by a period of so much disorder as to mark the beginning
of a new era for all Central Italy, and more especially
for Florence. The countess, as we know, left a will
bequeathing all her possessions to the Church; but this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
donation could only affect her allodial estates, since all
those held in fief naturally reverted to the Empire. It
was not always easy to precisely distinguish these from
those; often, indeed, impossible: hence an endless succession
of disputes. And such disputes became increasingly
complicated by the pretensions of the Pope and the
emperor, each of whom asserted his right to the whole
inheritance, the one as Matilda's universal legatee, and the
other as the supreme head of the margraviate. Then,
too, as we have seen, many considered themselves to have
been unjustly deprived of their estates, in favour of others
with no rightful claim. All this led to a real politico-social
crisis that brought the disorder to a climax. Thereupon
the emperor, Henry IV., sent a representative, bearing
the title of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Marchio, Iudex, Praeses</span></i>, to assume the government
of Tuscany in his name. Of course, no one could
legally contest his right to do this; but the Papal opposition,
the attitude of the cities now asserting their independence,
and the general disorder split the margraviate
into fragments. Accordingly the representatives of the
Empire could only place themselves at the head of the
feudal nobility of the various <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contadi</span></i> and, by gathering
them together, form a Germanic party opposed to the
cities. In the documents of the period the members of
this party are continually designated by the name of
Teutons (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Teutonici</span></i>).<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p>Florence, surrounded by the castled nobility occupying
her hills, could only decide on one of two courses.
Either to yield to those who had always been her mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
enemies, and were now emboldened by Henry's favour, or
to combat them openly, and thus declare enmity to the
Empire, the which, in the present state of affairs, would
amount to a proclamation of independence; and the latter
was the course adopted. Florence was now conscious of
her own strength, and recognised that safety could only
be gained by force. The change was accomplished in a
very simple and almost imperceptible way. The same
worthies who had administered justice, governed the
people, and commanded the garrison in Matilda's name,
now that she was dead, and no one in her place, continued
to rule in the name of the people, and asked its advice in
all grave emergencies. Thus these <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> became Consuls
of the Commune that may be said to have leapt into
existence unperceived. This is why no chroniclers
mention its birth, no documents record it, and a plain
and self-evident fact is made to appear extremely complicated
and obscure. In endeavouring to discover unknown
events and lost documents which had never existed, the
solution of a very easy problem was hedged round with
difficulties, while evident and well-established particulars
best fitted to explain it were entirely lost sight of.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we are not to believe that the event was
accomplished without any shock, for the change was of a
very remarkable kind. It is true that the actual government
remained almost intact; but its basis was altered,
since it was now carried on in the name of the people,
instead of that of the Countess. This, in itself, signified
little, inasmuch as for some time past the city had been
practically, if not legally, its own master, and the people
beginning to feel and make felt its personality. But the
social and political results of the change were neither few
nor inconsiderable. Naturally, during Matilda's reign,
the governing authorities were men of her choice; and
although all official and judicial posts changed hands from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
time to time, they became increasingly monopolised by a
small cluster of families, chief among whom, as we have
already said, were most probably the Uberti and their
clan. Now, however, that the authorities were to be
elected by the people, there was a broader, although
still somewhat limited, range of choice. Accordingly,
there was more change of office, and men were removed
in turn from one to another. This custom already prevailed
in other communes, and had been adopted even in
Florence both by popular associations and those of the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>. Hence it necessarily prevailed in the formation
of the new government.</p>

<p>Nor can we believe that those always to the front in
former times could have now withdrawn without resistance,
or without attempting to maintain their position
by favour of the Empire and the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Teutonici</span></i>; nor is it
credible that those now entitled to a larger share in the
government should have refrained from relying, in their
turn, on the strength of the popular favour, backed by
the most vital interests of the city. Friction between the
leading families seems inevitable to us in this state of things,
and Florence must have witnessed some such conflict as
at Pisa in Daiberto's day, and in almost all other Italian
communes. We learn from Villani (v. 30), from the
"Annales," and many other works, that there was a great
fire in Florence in 1115, a similar one in 1117, and that
"what was left unburned in the first fire was consumed
in the second." It was certainly an exaggeration to say
that the whole city was destroyed, but the fact of the fire
is generally <span class="locked">affirmed.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span> We also know that in those times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
before gunpowder was invented, fire and arson were the
most efficacious weapons in popular riots. Villani says,
farther, that "fighting went on among the citizens ...
sword in hand, in many parts of Florence." It is true,
that, in his opinion, the fight was <i>for the faith</i>, seeing that
the city being given over to heresy, licence, and the sect of
the Epicureans, God therefore chastised it with pestilence
and civil war. But, although we find no certain traces in
history of any widely diffused heresy in Florence at the
time, it is undoubted that from 1068 the earliest gleams
of Florentine freedom were mixed and confused, as we
have seen, with a religious movement, and it is also
certain that the "Annales," i., of the year 1120 record
the fact of one named Petrus Mingardole being condemned
for heresy to the ordeal by <span class="locked">fire,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span> and also add that,
between 1138 and 1173, the city was thrice smitten by
an interdict, all of which goes to prove a continued
religious agitation. Besides, Florence, and particularly
her people, remained constantly faithful to the Church
party, while the Uberti and their adherents, who sided
with the Empire, were opposed to it, and consequently,
in those days, may have easily incurred the charge of
heresy. Even in Villani's time the general name of
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Paterini</span></i> was bestowed not only upon all heretics, but on
Ghibellines as <span class="locked">well.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span> Besides, as he had placed the origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
of Florence before Charlemagne's day, and then again
immediately after the imaginary destruction of Fiesole
in 1010, he naturally refused to recognise that origin for
the third time at the moment of the Commune's real
birth. Accordingly, slurring over the political movement,
that was undoubtedly the main factor in the
change, he tried to exaggerate the religious movement
that played a very minor part in it.</p>

<p>At any rate, since it appears certain that the Uberti
asked the support of the Empire, they must have been
now necessarily driven to prove themselves foes of the
Church. Therefore, it cannot have been unusual for
them to be styled heretics or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Paterini</span></i>, especially by so
pronounced a Guelph as Villani. We know that the
Uberti were already powerful in Matilda's time, from the
frequent appearance of their name in contemporary documents.
That they also enjoyed a lion's share of the
government, and that the revolt was chiefly directed
against them, is explicitly proved by the words of a
chronicler&mdash;so far little read, we might almost say unknown&mdash;whose
work being derived from different sources
than that of Villani, shows some events in a new light.
The pseudo Brunetto Latini, in fact, agrees with the
other chroniclers in ascribing the first fire to the year
1115, saying that it began at the Santi Apostoli, and spread
as far as the bishop's palace, "whereby the greater part of
the city was burnt, and many folk perished in the flames."
He says nothing concerning heresy, but touching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
second fire of 1117, he adds: "In this year a fire broke
out in Florence in the houses of the Uberti, who <i>ruled</i> the
city, whereof little was saved from the burning, and many
folk perished by fire and <span class="locked">sword."<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span> It is evident that
there was a real outbreak, almost a revolution waged with
fire and sword, against the Uberti, rulers of the city.</p>

<p>Can we be surprised at the hatred roused by the Uberti,
or at the civil war of which they were the cause? As we
know, they were traditionally supposed to have come with
the Othos from Germany; and we have seen how the
legend of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Libro fiesolano</span></i>, while refusing credence to
this, spoke of them as descended from "the most noble
race of Catiline," the enemy of Florence. Even on
historical evidence, were they not the forefathers of those
Uberti, who afterwards, in 1177, proved the first to
attack the Consular government and begin the civil
warfare by which the city was so long torn asunder?
Were they not the forefathers of the Schiatta Uberti,
ringleaders of the band that stabbed Buondelmonti to
death, by the statue of Mars on the Ponte Vecchio, in
1215? Were they not the ancestors of the celebrated
Farinata, who routed the Guelphs at Montaperti, and
attended that Council of Empoli where such fierce
measures were proposed against Florence, the perpetual
nest of the Guelphs&mdash;the same Farinata described by Dante
among the heretics in the bog of hell?<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, which party conquered in the struggle
following Matilda's death? Facts prove it clearly
enough. In the year 1119 the Florentines made that
final assault on the castle of Monte Cascioli, to which
reference has been already made. This is the moment
when the before-mentioned <i>Rempoctus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> or Rabodo, really
comes upon the scene, although Villani (iv. 29) and other
chroniclers make him appear in 1113, under the name of
Robert the German, Imperial vicar, and suppose him to
have fallen in fight that year while defending the castle.
We have shown that there could be no Imperial vicar in
Tuscany at that date, seeing that none was sent until
after Matilda's decease. In fact, no documents mention
any vicar before then, and only on September 11, 1116,
we find one recorded as "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rabodo ex largitione Imperatoris
Marchio Tuscia</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and then in 1119, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rabodo Dei
gratia si quid est</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> the identical formula that had been
employed in Matilda's patents. In 1120 Rabodo's name
disappears, and is replaced by that of the Margrave
Corrado. It may therefore be taken for granted that
Rabodo really perished in 1119 during the defence of
Monte Cascioli against the Florentines, who now succeeded
in finally demolishing the stronghold and burning
it to the <span class="locked">ground.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span> Thus their first achievement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
after Matilda's decease, was the destruction of a
Cadolingi castle, together with the defeat and death in
battle of the first Imperial vicar then established in
Tuscany. This is more than enough to show the nature
of their attitude with regard to the Empire and the
Teutonic party.</p>

<p>Shortly after, an event of even greater significance
occurred in the capture and sack of Fiesole during 1125.
Sanzanome, whose so-called modern history of Florence
starts with this war, describes it at much length, in flights
of wordy rhetoric. The gist of it is that the chief cause
of the conflict was a commercial dispute. The people of
Fiesole would seem to have maltreated and plundered a
Florentine trader who was quietly passing through the
city with his goods. This incident, added to the remembrance
of past rancours and other recent depredations, seems
to have stirred the Florentines to war. Instantly, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">factum
est Consilium per tunc dominantes Consules de processu.</span>"
One of the leading citizens harangued the people, beginning
his speech with these words: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Si de nobili Romanorum
prosapia originem duximus ... decet nos patrum adherere
vestigiis.</span>" Thereupon, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">illico a Consulibus exivit edictum.</span>"
A man of Fiesole, on the other hand, began his
address by alluding to the legendary origin of his city:
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Viri, frates, qui ab Ytalo sumpsistis originem, a quo tota
Ytalia dicitur esse derivata.</span>" Although so much learned
rhetoric in a writer of the early part of the thirteenth
century is another proof of the strong influence of Roman
tradition on ancient Florentines, both before and after the
rise of their Commune, it cannot conceal the real cause of
the war, as proved even by the evidence of Villani, whose
chronicle begins to acquire greater historic value at this
point. The latter relates that Fiesole had become a
veritable nest of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Cattani</span></i> and brigands, who infested the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Florentine highways and <span class="locked">territories.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span> As usual, the feudal
barons were swooping down from their strongholds to
hinder the trade and traffic of the Commune.</p>

<p>At this moment also there were special causes tending
to provoke a war of an unusually sanguinary kind. The
counties, or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contadi</span></i>, of the two cities, as sometimes
occurred elsewhere, had been carved out of the territories
of bishoprics, based, in their turn, on ancient Roman
partitions of the soil. Accordingly, these counties being
not only adjacent, but wedged in and almost tangled one
with the other, and their respective bishops having never
wielded, as in Lombardy, the authority or power of
counts they had ended by forming a single, combined
jurisdiction. In fact, many documents refer to the county
or jurisdiction of Fiesole and Florence, as though it were
one and the same thing. Hence it was only natural that on
becoming an independent Commune, after Matilda's death,
Florence should seek to dominate over both counties, and
equally natural that Fiesole should be violently opposed
to the idea, and, notwithstanding the inferior size of the
town, should have trusted to the superior strength of its
fortified position, and, making alliance with the nobles of
the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, should have harboured them in the citadel,
and joined them in continual attacks on Florentine traders
or in raiding Florentine lands. This was the beginning
of the war. Its details are unknown to us, those supplied
by Sanzanome being too extravagant for <span class="locked">belief,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span> and other
chroniclers furnishing none at all. Seeing the strength of
Fiesole's position, the campaign could have been neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
short nor easy, and undoubtedly ended in cruel slaughter and
the almost total destruction of the town. The chroniclers
are not the only authorities for this fact. Shortly afterwards,
the Abbot Atto of Vallombrosa implored a pardon from
Pope Honorius II., <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro Florentinorum excessibus</span></i>, urging
in their favour that there were many aged persons, women,
and children, in Florence, who had assuredly taken no
part in the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">destruccio fesulana</span></i>, and also that many participants
in the war now confessed the error of their ways,
and sincerely repented all the excesses that "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">non meditata
nequitia commisere.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> The event was long remembered
in Florence, is frequently recorded in <span class="locked">documents,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span> and,
together with the rout of the Imperial vicar at Monte
Cascioli, undoubtedly contributed to establish the independence
of the Commune on a firmer basis.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>It is certain that Florence now had a separate government
under Consuls of her own, although there is no
documentary proof to this effect earlier than 1138.
Sanzanome, however, makes explicit allusion to it at the
time of the Fiesole campaign, when, as we have seen, war
was declared by the Consuls. But what was the real
nature and origin of this new magistracy? Formerly it
was opined by many writers that the Consuls were an
institution derived in general from the judges of older
days. In Lombardy they would have been merely
another form of the Frankish <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">scabini</span></i>, and accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
in Florence it was natural to suppose them to be an
altered survival of those judges of the margravial
tribunal to whom, for some time before her death,
Matilda had accorded the right to give sentence. But
this view can be no longer maintained, since it does not
comprise the whole truth of the matter. For even when
the Consuls are seen in the exercise of their functions,
what are they, what do they do, according to chronicles
and documents? They conduct wars, conclude treaties
in the name of the people, of whom they are the representatives;
they govern the city; they administer justice.
And at Florence, as elsewhere, the latter is only one of
their duties, and only undertaken by them because so
closely connected with the exercise of the political power
that is, above all, their genuine and principal function.
Besides, what was it that really led to the birth of the
Florentine Commune? What save the lack of the
higher political authority hitherto ruling Tuscany, and
the necessity of making war against old and new foes!
Accordingly the military and political elements unavoidably
prevailed.</p>

<p>We are further confirmed in this idea by examining the
constitution of the Consular bench. At first it would seem
that all or some of the Consuls presided without distinction,
while later, three members were chosen in turn, and
entitled <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consules super facto iustitiae</span></i>, or even <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consules de
iustitia</span></i>, to preside for one month; at a still later date
two Consuls presided for a term of two months, and
finally, after the nature of the primitive government has
been changed, we find a single Consul acting as president
throughout a whole <span class="locked">year.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
They might be, but were not necessarily, legal experts,
since they only pronounced and confirmed the judgment
decided upon without either preparing or formulating it.
This duty fell to a real <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">iudex ordinarius pro Comune</span></i>,
together with three proveditors or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">provisores</span></i>, who
examined the case and wrote the sentence. The Consuls
merely sat as presidents of the tribunal, and when, as
sometimes occurred, they failed to appear, the tribunal
acted on its own account. Therefore their office was
practically the same as that of Countess Matilda herself&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
to represent sovereignty without filling the place of
<span class="locked">judges.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span></p>

<p>The real nature of the new government will be best
understood after investigating the different elements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the civic body from which that government was necessarily
evolved. As we are aware, there were two leading
classes and interests dividing the city between them&mdash;that
is, the trade guilds, and the associations of worthies, or
of the Towers. In numerical strength the people had
greatly the advantage; but the worthies (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>) were
far more cultivated, trained to arms and politics, and
already somewhat versed in the art of government.
Therefore, the Consuls were recruited from this class, and
at first always chosen from so small a number of families,
that the office appeared to be almost an hereditary one.
The misfortune of Florence, as indeed of all the other communes,
Venice excepted, was that the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> were never
agreed among themselves. Feudal nobility in Italy
resembled an exotic plant transferred to uncongenial soil.
Elsewhere, being of German origin, it formed part of an
entire political system; it was under the orders of the
emperor to whom it adhered; it had certain heroic
qualities; it created a special form of civilisation, and a
literature that flourished in France and Germany, but it
never throve in Italy, and in Tuscany least of all. Our
feudal lords, being solely dominated by personal interests,
leant on the Empire, the better to combat the Pope; on
the Pope, to combat the Empire; on the one or the other
indiscriminately to combat the cities. Even on Florentine
territory the same thing continually occurred. The
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> established within the city walls were, it is true,
of a very different temper, and much nearer to the people,
whose life they shared; but they comprised very discordant
elements; for whereas some of these <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> had
risen from the people, others were descended from feudal
houses, with whom they maintained friendly relations and
on whose aid they could rely. Thirst for power was a
speedy cause of division among them, and the ease with
which one party gained favour with the working classes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
while the other was backed by the nobles of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>,
fostered the growth of civil strife. Then, later on, as
more nobles deserted their castles for the city, a regularly
aristocratic and Ghibelline party was formed in opposition
to the Guelph and popular side. This point, however, was
still far removed, for the common necessity of making
head against the baronage of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> long prevailed
over all other interests, since the very life of the Commune
was involved in that struggle.</p>

<p>All that we have so far related serves to show with increasing
clearness that two quite distinct classes of citizens
already existed in Florence&mdash;namely, that of the people or
trades (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">arti</span></i>), and that of the worthies (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>). Had
the new government been evolved from the trades alone,
it would have assumed a form constituted on the basis
of a trade guild. Had it issued from the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> alone,
it would have given rise to a regional and local constitution,
corresponding with the <i>sestieri</i> of the city over which
their abodes were scattered. In all Italian communes this
double tendency is to be found. In Rome the constitution
by districts, or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">rioni</span></i>, prevailed; while at Florence,
after a time, the constitution by guilds obtained in consequence
of the enormous prosperity of commerce and
industry in that city. Meanwhile, however, the moral
predominance of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> and the pressing exigencies
of war favoured a division of the city in <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestieri</span></i>, whereby
the first assembling and organising of the army was greatly
facilitated. It was for this reason that the Consuls were
elected by their respective <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestieri</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> That the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>
were already organised in "Societies of the Towers"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
there is written evidence to prove. A document of 1165
alludes to these societies as having been in existence for
some <span class="locked">time,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span> and the parchments of the Florence Archives
comprise actual fragments of their statutes dated only a
few years later <span class="locked">on.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span> The "Tower" was possessed in
common by the partners or associates, and no share in it
could be bequeathed to any one outside the society, or
to any member elected by less than all votes save one.
Women were naturally excluded. The expense of maintaining
and fortifying the Tower, which always communicated
with the houses of neighbouring members, and
served for their common defence, was divided among
them all. Three or more rectors, also sometimes called
Consuls, managed the society, settled disputes, and named
their own successors. These rectors and their companions
are the men we now find at the head of the
government; and there is clear documentary evidence that
the Consuls of the Commune were almost invariably chosen
from families belonging to the Societies of the Towers.
When, too, we observe that some of them were occasionally
nominated Consuls of the <span class="locked">guilds,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span> as Cavalcanti, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
example, and several others, we gain an undoubted proof
of the friendly terms preserved, as we have previously
noted, between these nobles and the people. The
societies were organised somewhat after the fashion of the
guilds, by which they may have been originally inspired,
and were not on a strictly feudal <span class="locked">basis.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span></p>

<p>Had the more aristocratic Uberti achieved sole predominance
in the city, things would have assuredly
taken a different turn; but these patricians were compelled,
although reluctantly, to yield to the force of
events frequently opposed to their views. In fact, they
were seldom Consuls before the year 1177, when, after
exciting a genuine revolution, they were more frequently
named to that post. This confirms the fact of their
previous defeat in 1115. The consular government had
then fallen into the hands of several noble families on
good terms with the people. And it was the popular
voice that prevailed in the assemblies where all the chief
questions and interests of the State were decided.</p>

<p>The <span class="locked">Consuls<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span> were elected at the beginning of the year,
two for each <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestieri</span></i>. At least, this seems to have been
the ordinary number, although we cannot be quite certain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
since the number was not invariably the same. Two of
the twelve, chosen in rotation, acted as heads of the
college, and were styled <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consules priores</span></i>. For this reason
the chroniclers only mentioned two Consuls as a rule, and
sometimes one alone. In documents two, three, or even
more are mentioned, but always as representing the rest
of their colleagues, whose names are often added. Most
rarely and only at exceptional moments do we find record
of a higher number than <span class="locked">twelve.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span> Then perhaps because
the retiring Consuls continued in office with the new ones
for a few days, or from some other passing cause that is
unknown to us. Such variations are not surprising if it
is kept in mind that the constitution of Florence, being
then in course of formation, must have been liable to
uncertainty and change, as will often be seen further on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Attention should now be called to the popular element in
the constitution. That the guilds were solidly established by
the early part of the twelfth century is indubitably proved.
Villani says that towards the year 1150 the Consuls of the
Merchants, or rather of the "Calimala Guild," were entrusted
by the Commune of Florence with the building works of
"San Giovanni" (i. 60). Of still greater significance is
the fact that on February 3, 1182, the men of Empoli, in
making submission to Florence, were bound to make a
yearly payment of fifty pounds of "good money" (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">buoni
denari</span></i>) to the Consuls or Rectors of the city, and, failing
these officials, to the Consuls of the <span class="locked">Merchants,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span> as representing
the Commune. Now, if these Consuls had reached
so high a degree of importance in 1182, we are entitled
to believe that the guild was of no recent origin. And
remembering that the guild in question was the Calimala&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
that of finishers and dyers of woollen cloths manufactured
abroad, and more especially in Flanders, imported
by Florence, and thence despatched to foreign markets&mdash;we
shall understand that Florentine commerce must have
already attained a prodigious development, and consequently
that many of the guilds must have been already
long established. A solitary instance would naturally
afford little proof, since it might be open to various
interpretations; but others can be adduced to the same
effect. In a treaty between Lucca and Florence of July
21, 1184, we find a stipulation according to which the
terms might be modified by the Florentine Consuls
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">comuni populo electi</span></i>, and by twenty-five counsellors,
provided, as was expressly declared, the Consuls of the
merchants were comprised in the <span class="locked">number.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> Likewise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
when the men of Trebbio made submission on July 14,
1193, the power of incorporating the agreement in the
City Statutes was exclusively reserved to the seven <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rectores
qui sunt super Capitibus Artium</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>But a final observation occurs to us at this point, again
showing the very uncertain and changeable nature of this
consular government. In mentioning the chief authorities
of the Commune, almost all documents refer to them as
"<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consules seu rectores vel rector</span></i>," with the addition, at a
later date, of "<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Potestas sive dominator</span></i>."<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> All these terms
had a very general meaning at the period. Nevertheless,
there must have been some reason for employing the
formula&mdash;Consuls or Rectors or <i>Potestà</i>&mdash;in treaties of
peace, or alliance, or state documents of high importance;
and probably a special reason, seeing that we often find
the formula ending as follows: "<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consules qui pro tempore
erint, et si non erint</span></i>," the Rectors or the <i>Potestà</i> or the
Consuls of the guilds were to act in their stead. Why so
much vagueness in indicating the chief magistrate of the
Republic? Only one explanation is possible. The real
practical government of the city was carried on by the
various associations; the office of Consul had few attributes
and never attained the power and importance due to
a central government, as conceived in the modern sense.
The same remark may be also applied to the Priors, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Ancients, and other officers of later date; but it is specially
true as applied to the consuls, under whom the various
civic societies were first united in a single government.
Therefore, to meet the eventuality of no Consuls being
in office at the moment, it was provided that the Rectors
of the Towers or of the guilds should naturally assume
the power directly emanating from them. But as no
public acts performed in the name of the Rectors are
extant, we may conclude that the contingency arranged
for seldom arose.</p>

<p>Frequent mention occurs of <i>counsellors</i> (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">consilarii</span></i>), and
we note that representatives of the guilds were comprised
among them. We know, in fact, that there was a council
in Florence, as in other Italian communes, and Villani
tells us (iv. 7, and v. 32) that this council was called a
senate "according to the custom given by the Romans to
the Florentines," and composed of one hundred worthies
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Buoni Uomini</span></i>). In documents, however, they are nearly
always entitled <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">consiliarii</span></i>, the term <span class="locked">"senator"<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span> only
occurring once; but in those days the term <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">senato</span></i> or
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">consiglio</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">senatori</span></i> or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">consiglieri</span></i>, were often indiscriminately
applied, particularly with regard to the limited or
<i>Special</i> Council, as it was afterwards called. No documents
supply us with the precise number of the councillors; but
we believe the one hundred recorded by Villani must be
somewhat under the exact figure, since a form of oath
sworn by 133 councillors is <span class="locked">extant.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> Perhaps each <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestiere</span></i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
elected about twenty or twenty-five members, without
this being the invariable rule, and thus the Council might
be approximately designated as that of the "Hundred."
Then, too, there was the parliament, also known as the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Arengo</span></i>,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> which was a general assembly of the people,
held on great occasions for the gravest affairs of the State.</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>Thus the Florentine Commune resembled a confederation
of Trade Guilds and Societies of the Towers. Its
directing authorities for affairs of war, finance, justice, and
other matters of the highest importance, were the Consuls,
elected yearly, with a senate or council of about a
hundred worthies, likewise elected yearly, and lastly a
parliament. The Consuls were almost invariably chosen
from members of the Companies of the Towers, and if,
for any reason, no election of Consuls took place, the
rectors of the Towers or of the guilds were provisionally
empowered to act in their stead. But the guilds predominated
in the Council, and as a natural consequence
the government assumed a popular character from that
time, and the whole policy of Florence always tended to
promote the trade and commerce of the city.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, to obtain a still clearer idea of a government
of this kind, it would be requisite to ascertain
exactly who and what were the citizens entitled to a
share in it, and this point is still somewhat doubtful.
The outlying territory (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>) was entirely excluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
from citizenship, nor was this privilege granted to all
dwellers within the walls, the lower class of artisans and
the populace being excluded from <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span> Hence the government
was concentrated in the hands of a few powerful
families, the heads of the guilds, and their principal
adherents. In fact, even down to the last days of the
Republic real citizenship&mdash;the possessors of which alone
were eligible to political posts&mdash;was a privilege conceded
to few, and even in 1494 the number of citizens scarcely
exceeded three thousand. For this reason, even at the
present day, we may find a few humble families asserting
their inheritance of old Florentine civic rights, as a rare
privilege and almost as a title of nobility. At Venice,
even in the eighteenth century, to the last days of the
Republic there still existed different grades of citizenship,
and the right of government was restricted to a small
caste. This is one of the points in our history demanding
closer investigation. It is true that the whole people
met indistinctly in parliament; but such assemblies were
mostly of a purely formal kind. For, seeing that the
parliament was convoked either in some square, often of
small extent, or inside a church, we are bound to infer
that the privilege accorded to all the inhabitants of the
city was nominal rather than real.</p>

<p>It were likewise superfluous to add that the exact
division of power, as in modern constitutions, was entirely
ignored in those days. Affairs were divided according to
their importance and the quality of the individuals concerned
in them, rather than according to their nature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
The Council of the Hundred was not, as might be supposed,
at this day, a legislative assembly, nor was the executive
power vested in the Consuls. The latter gave judgment,
administered affairs, commanded armies, executed the will
of the people, and occasionally completed legislative acts
even without the aid of the Council. This, however, was
always consulted regarding very important reforms, but
often voted for or against them without any discussion.
On questions of extraordinary moment the parliament
gave its <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">placet</span></i> without always understanding the nature
of the question. On the other hand, not only affairs of
some gravity, and particularly those for which money was
needed, were referred to the Council; but this could also
be consulted, at the Consul's pleasure, on any question
whatever, from the proposed execution of some political
offender to granting some citizen permission to transfer
his abode from one <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestiere</span></i> to <span class="locked">another.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span> Although a
question of the latter kind seems very insignificant to us
nowadays, it was an important one then, since it altered
the distribution of the inhabitants in different parts of the
city, and consequently the relative strength of these parts
and the proportional right of the citizens to fill public
offices&mdash;a point that was very jealously watched.</p>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 130.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>Such was the first form of government adopted by the
Florentine Commune. But the Commune was not yet
consolidated nor sufficiently sure of its strength. The
territory beneath its sway was very limited in extent, with
ill-defined, disputable and disputed frontiers. Even
within these borders the Commune had very little power,
inasmuch as the castled nobility not only vaunted their
independence of the city, refusing to acknowledge any
authority save that of the Empire, to which they were
not always submissive, but waged constant war on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Commune, and perpetually incited neighbouring lands to
rebellion. Accordingly, the first thing to be done at this
juncture was to seize the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> by force of arms,
reduce it to subjection and govern it, the which, as we
shall see, led to many new and serious complications, both
within and without the walls. These vicissitudes constitute
the real civil history of Florence, which finally
starts from this moment.</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">AFTER</span> Countess Matilda's death the
envoys despatched from Germany to
reassume the margraviate of Tuscany
in the name of the Empire followed
one another in rapid <span class="locked">succession.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span> But
almost all were men of small ability,
pursuing a vacillating policy that led to no results.
They tried to exercise the power of margraves, but
were merely temporary officials of the emperor.
Without resources, without knowledge of the country,
they relied now on this party, now on that, incapable
of distinguishing friends from foes, and never understanding
the causes of the wars continually breaking
out on every side. This state of things, well adapted to
promote communal independence, lasted to 1162, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Frederic Barbarossa began to make the weight of his
hand felt by initiating a clearer and more determined
policy, although even his talent failed to obtain any
notable results.</p>

<p>The Florentines were those best able to profit by the
weakness of the Empire. In 1129 they took possession
of the Castle of Vignalo in the Val <span class="locked">d'Elsa;<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span> and in 1135
destroyed the stronghold of Monteboni, belonging to the
Buondelmonti, whose name was derived from it, and
who were now forced to submit to the Commune, yield
it military service, and dwell in the city a certain part of
the <span class="locked">year.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span> On this head Villani remarks that the Commune
now began to extend its borders "by violence
rather than by reason, ... subjecting every noble of the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, and demolishing fortresses." This was, in fact,
the policy of Florence, and it led to two inevitable
results. An increase of territory was the first; the
second, that the always-increasing number of nobles
brought into the city paved the way for the formation
of an aristocratic party opposed to the people, and consequently
promoting civil strife and future changes of
government.</p>

<p>In June, 1135, the Imperial envoy Engelbert entered
Florence, and seemed amicable to the <span class="locked">Commune.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span> He
speedily moved on to Lucca, where he met with a serious
defeat. The succeeding envoy, Errico of Bavaria, came
with a considerable force, and appeared ill-disposed towards
the Florentines. His stay, however, was short, and his
successor, Ulrico d'Attems, showed friendly intentions,
and in 1141 even aided the Florentines in a skirmishing
expedition against <span class="locked">Sienna.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span> But all these envoys came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
disappeared like meteors. Florence was now beginning
its great war with Count Guido, surnamed the Old, who
had become their foe. A contested inheritance served as
a pretext for the rupture; but the real cause must have
lain in the increased power and menacing attitude of the
count. His possessions hemmed in the Republic on
all sides, and Sanzanome said of him, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Per se quasi
civitas est et provincia.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> The citizens first seized a
castle of his near Ponte a Sieve, and then attacked his
stronghold of Monte di Croce. But, aided by neighbouring
towns, the count succeeded in defeating the
Florentines on June 24, 1146. Nevertheless, they contrived
even then to extort advantageous terms, namely:
that part of the walls should be dismantled, and that
the castle should hoist the banner of <span class="locked">Florence.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span> All
this was done, and there was truce for a time, while the
count seems to have been engaged on distant expeditions.
But later, the walls were restored, and thereupon the
<span class="locked">Florentines,<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> declaring that the agreement had been violated,
suddenly stormed the castle in 1153, and rased it
to the ground. And thus, wrote Sanzanome, "<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Mons
Crucis est cruciatus</span></i>." Certainly all this could not lead to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
peace. Count Guido ceded part of Poggibonsi to the
Siennese on condition of their fortifying and defending it
against the Florentines, who were preparing to make an
assault. By accepting the gift Sienna stood pledged to
play an active part in the war, which thus continued to
<span class="locked">spread.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Just at this time, however, the state of affairs changed,
for Tuscany was beginning to feel the influence of
Frederic I. (Barbarossa). This emperor, finding that
Duke Guelfo was unable to make himself respected,
despatched (1162&ndash;3) the Archbishop Reinhold of
Cologne, a man of energy and brains, with the title
of "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Italiae archicancellarius et imperatoriae maiestatis
legatus</span>," and charged to reorganise the Imperial administration
on a new plan. Frederic regarded the dissolution
of the margraviate as an accomplished fact, and wished
to assume the direct government of its various component
parts by means of German counts or Podestà, in the
manner already adopted by him in Lombardy. Reinhold
set to the task with zeal, establishing German governors
and garrisons in the principal castles of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>; and
where no castles remained new ones were <span class="locked">erected.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span> San
Miniato, with its tower on the hill, dominating the suburb
of San Genesio below, was the headquarters of this new
administration. Here Reinhold established Eberhard von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Amern with the title of "<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Comes et Federici imperatoris
legatus</span></i>."<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> Frederic's scheme of policy was clear and
precise; but in order to carry it into effect against the
will of communes that were already emancipated, and
against the interests of many native counts, would have
required much time and a great army, both of which were
lacking at the moment. Reinhold was soon called elsewhere
for other undertakings, and although his successor,
the Archbishop Christian of Mayence, was likewise a man
of ability, their efforts led to few practical results. Their
only success consisted in the amount of money squeezed
from the people; for, as a chronicler puts it, "like good
fishermen, they drew everything cleverly into their nets."
But they established no firm political basis.</p>

<p>It is true that the new German Podestà, or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Teutonici</span></i>, as
they were called, were seen springing up on all sides. We
now find, in fact, continual mention of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Potestas
Florentiae and Florentinorum</span></i>, and of the same dignitaries
in Sienna, Arezzo, and many other towns. Nevertheless,
they exercised little or no power in great cities:
these being still governed by Consuls, who disputed the
authority of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Teutonici</span></i> of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> outside the walls.
This state of things could not be of long continuance. By
special permission from the emperor, the Consuls of certain
well-affected cities were allowed to exercise jurisdiction,
in his name, not only within the walls, but even sometimes
over part of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>; always, however, with a
reservation in favour of nobles, and often of churches and
convents, who were to remain subject to the Imperial
authority <span class="locked">alone.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span> Everywhere else in Central Italy the
Imperial Podestà were to take the entire command, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
emperor admitted no doubt as to the complete and absolute
nature of his rights. But the question now hinged on
facts rather than on rights, and was only to be solved by
a greater force than that possessed by the Empire in Tuscany.
Hence, an enormous confusion ensued. All the
great cities, and more especially Florence, continued to
rule themselves as before; while in the rural territories
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contadi</span></i>), Imperial Podestà, Tuscan counts, feudal lords,
Consuls great and small, or other officers of the Commune,
daily contested one another's authority, and the masses no
longer knew whom to obey. Even the cities and nobles
siding with the Empire not only failed to carry out
Frederic's designs, but actually opposed them; for, in
point of fact, this Teutonic over-lordship, wielded by
grasping and tyrannous Imperial officials, was equally
odious to all.</p>

<p>A sufficiently accurate idea of this state of things may
be gleaned from the accounts of contemporary witnesses,
who were summoned at various times to furnish authentic
details as to the condition of the country. Those sent
to report upon the monastery of Rosano describe it as
being subject to Count Guido, who was continually driven
to defend it "against the warden of Montegrossoli, other
Teutons, and the Florentine Consuls," all of whom tried
to exercise authority there. They also describe how at
Monte di Croce, the Consuls of that place and the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice
comites</span></i> all held command simultaneously, and were compelled
to defend themselves from the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Teutonici</span></i>, and
against the encroachments of the Consuls and other officers
of the Florentine <span class="locked">Commune.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span></p>

<p>On another occasion an equally chaotic state of things
is described in the reports on the castle and valley of
Paterno, of which Florentines and Siennese disputed the
dominion. One witness tells us that in his day he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
a certain Pipino, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Potestas Florentiae</span></i>, holding sway there,
and over all the rest of the Florentine <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>. Another
records how he visited the Paterno valley and the whole
of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, together with the consuls of the Commune
and a <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Teutonico</span></i>. Several declare to have gone there now
with Pipino, now with other <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Teutonici</span></i>, and at other times
with the Consuls, and that all received obedience and
levied taxes in the same way. Then we have the curious
deposition of one Giovanni <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">de Citinaia</span></i>, who gives a long
account of recent events in the district. He tells us how
a big pillar was uprooted by a priest, who, not knowing
for what purpose it had been planted, wanted to use
it for the church he was building. But it was so heavy
that even with a cart and two oxen he failed to remove
it. And some peasants who were looking on, cried out
to him: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Domini sacerdos, male fecisti, quia est terminus
inter Florentinos et Senenses</span>" ("Master priest, thou hast
done ill, for this is the boundary stone between Florence
and Sienna"). After this, the witness continues, two persons
went to the warden of Montegrossoli, and said that if
he would help them to rebuild the Castle of Paterno,
they would furnish him with proofs of his right over it.
The warden cheerfully hastened to Florence to get the
permission of the authorities, but quickly returned, saying
that the building could not go on, for the Florentines
refused consent, because the Archbishop Christian of
Mayence was already in Lombardy on the way to
Tuscany. Thereupon the Siennese made use of the
favourable opportunity to demolish the neglected works,
and play the masters themselves. It is certainly impossible
to conceive a greater multiplicity and confusion
of contrasting rights and <span class="locked">authorities.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Hence the only course open to Florence and the
Tuscan communes in general was to seize every convenient
occasion of asserting their rights either by
craft or by violence. The war between Pisa and Lucca
had already broken out, and as Count Guido, the foe of
the Florentines, had joined with Lucca, they formed an
alliance with Pisa. This treaty was very advantageous
to their commerce, but it pledged them to an active
share in the <span class="locked">war.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span> They willingly undertook this, for it
was an opportunity of fighting not only the Lucchese,
but also the latter's patrons, Count Guido and Christian
of Mayence. At first it seemed as though Pisa would be
forced to make peace, for on March 23, 1173, Christian
declared that city to be under ban of the Empire, thus
stripping it of all the privileges it had previously enjoyed.
In fact, on the 23rd of May an agreement was concluded
(witnessed also by the Florentines) to the effect that
Pisa and Lucca should proceed to an exchange of
prisoners. The ban was raised on the 28th of the same
month, and peace was solemnly proclaimed in Pisa on
the 1st of June.</p>

<p>But two months afterwards an unexpected event
caused the war to be speedily renewed. The archbishop
had invited the Consuls of Pisa and Florence to come to
San Genesio on the 4th of August, and on their arrival
had them promptly seized and cast into prison. What
could have caused an act rendering war unavoidable, after
such strenuous efforts to establish peace? Many explanations
have been suggested, but one fact alone is well
ascertained. Certain men of San Miniato, having been
expelled as rebels to the Empire, had sought the Bishop
of <span class="locked">Florence<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span> in his palace, and sworn not only to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
common cause with the Pisans and Florentines, but to
cede them the territory of San Miniato, should they
succeed in retaking it, and even if the fortress remained
in the hands of the <span class="locked">Germans.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span> This is certainly true,
for the document containing the agreement is still extant.
It is no regular treaty, being unwitnessed by Consuls,
and lacking the proper legal formulas. But the fact of
its having been sworn to and signed in the bishop's palace;
of some leading citizens, including one of the <span class="locked">Uberti,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span>
having been parties to it; and of the document being
preserved in the <span class="locked">Archives,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span> proves that the rulers of the
two cities were not unaware of the agreement, but merely
preferred to hide, or rather disguise the real importance
of it. All this, joined to their reluctance and delay as to
the exchange of prisoners, persuaded Christian that they
were trying to trick and betray him by a fictitious peace.
Accordingly, his patience being exhausted, he was led to
commit an imprudent and ill-considered action, that
destroyed all hope of the peace he was so anxious to
conclude.</p>

<p>In fact, by August the Florentines were already at
Castel Fiorentino, and, reinforced by a contingent of 225
horse, accompanied by two Consuls from Pisa, encamped
at Pontedera. Christian quickly marched against them,
together with Guido and the Lucchese, but the latter
were obliged to forsake him, for the Pisans, by advice
of the Florentines, had entered the Lucca territory and
were laying it waste. Notwithstanding his diminished
force he attacked the enemy, and valiantly defended his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
banner, but was worsted in the fight. How the war went
on is unknown to us; but it is certain that Christian soon
took his departure, that in 1174 the rebels of San Miniato
returned with honour to their native town, and that finally
in the following year peace was concluded between the
three hostile <span class="locked">cities.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Florentines continued to subject the
towns and castles of the territory to their <span class="locked">rule.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span> Before
this, in 1170, they had wrung hard conditions from the
<span class="locked">Aretines,<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span> who were friendly to Count Guido, and they
now marched against Asciano, a walled town near Arezzo,
partly under their rule and partly under that of the
Siennese, who were now trying to get full possession of it.
The latter were routed on July 7, 1174, and leaving a
thousand prisoners in the enemy's hands were accordingly
obliged to submit to very disadvantageous <span class="locked">terms.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span> The
negotiations were carried on slowly, but peace was
concluded at last in 1176.</p>

<p>The Florentines were acknowledged as the legitimate
masters of the whole <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> of Fiesole and Florence, and
obtained part of the Siennese possessions at Poggibonsi, the
said Siennese being bound to help them in all <span class="locked">wars,<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span> save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
against the emperor or his envoys, and likewise pledged
to use every endeavour to conciliate the latter in favour
of Florence. Several more of the conditions were particularly
<span class="locked">harsh.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span> That the Florentines could extort such
terms as these after the petty war of Asciano is an
undeniable proof of their increased power; but it is
equally certain that unless the Siennese were hopelessly
ruined, this was only a fictitious peace, concluded after
great hesitation, and for the sole purpose of securing the
release of the prisoners.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, these triumphs abroad were counteracted
by unforeseen events in Florence itself. Owing to the
prevalence of the popular party in the consular government,
powerful houses in general, and the Uberti faction in
particular, were increasingly excluded from public affairs,
and naturally showed signs of discontent. At this moment
we seldom find any of their names at the head of the
<span class="locked">Commune.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span> Meanwhile, however, many neighbouring
castles and lands having been reduced to submission, the
number of nobles of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> dwelling in the city had
been greatly augmented. These, being merely counted as
<i>assidui habitatores</i> or <i>cives salvatichi</i>, could have no share
in the government, but there was nothing to prevent them
from joining the disaffected party and swelling its numbers
and strength. And when, in course of time, they
became full citizens, their power of action was enlarged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Accordingly, at last, in 1177, the Uberti were encouraged
to hazard the revolution that first initiated civil war in
Florence.</p>

<p>All the chroniclers speak of this war, and it must
have been of considerable importance, seeing that it was
pursued for nearly two years with much bloodshed and
the destruction by fire of the greater part of the city.
Likewise, the river Arno overflowed and broke down the
Ponte Vecchio. Villani describes the two fires of 1177,
saying that the first extended from the bridge to the Old
Market; the second, from San Martino del Vescovo to
Santa Maria Ughi and the Cathedral. He also relates the
fall of the bridge, adding, as usual, that all this was a
righteous chastisement from Heaven on the proud, ungrateful,
sinful city. He speaks of the revolution that
occurred at the same time as though it had nothing to do
with the burning of the town. He goes on to say that
the Uberti, who were the "principal and most powerful
citizens of Florence, with their followers, both noble and
plebeian, began to make war against the Consuls, lords
and rulers of the Commune, at a fixed moment and on
a fixed plan, from hatred of the Signory, which was
not to their liking. And the war was so fierce, that in
many parts neighbours fought against neighbours from
fortified towers, the which were 100 to 120 <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">braccia</span></i> in
height (150 to 180 feet). Likewise certain new towers
were erected by the street companies with monies obtained
from neighbours, and these were called the Towers of the
Companies.</p>

<p>For two years the fighting went on in this fashion, and
with much slaughter; and the citizens became so inured
to perpetual strife, that they would fight one day and eat
and drink together the next, recounting one to another
their various deeds and prowess. At last, tired out, they
made peace, and the Consuls remained in power; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
these things created and gave birth to the accursed factions
which soon broke out in <span class="locked">Florence."<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, the pseudo Brunetto Latini dates the
first fire extending from the bridge to the Old Market,
on August 4, 1177. But he quickly adds that in the
same year began the "discord and war, for the space of
twenty-seven months, between the Consuls and the Uberti,
who refused to obey either the Consuls or the Signory,
yet nevertheless formed no government of their own. This
strife among the citizens caused great mortality, robbery,
and arson. The city was set on fire at five different
points; the Sesto d'Oltràrno, and the part between the
Churches of San Martino, del Vescovo, and Sta. Maria,
were burnt <span class="locked">down."<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span> According to the same chronicler,
the fall of the bridge took place on November 4, 1178,
and the civil war only came to an end in 1180, with
the triumph of the Uberti, one of whom, Uberto degli
Uberti, actually became Consul. "The which afterwards
led to the creation of Podestà, who were nobles, powerful,
and of foreign <span class="locked">birth."<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
In spite of a few seeming contradictions on the part of
both chroniclers, their evidence, joined to that of others,
clearly proves that in 1177 a revolution led by the
Uberti took place and lasted about two years, accompanied
by rapine, murder, and arson. The Uberti did not gain
a complete victory, since the consular government survived;
but they and their friends were in power more
frequently than before, and for this reason the pseudo
Brunetto Latini considers them to have conquered. All
this gave the government a more patrician tendency. It
heralded the change that replaced the Consuls by a
Podestà, and cast the first seed of the factions and civil
wars destined to involve the city in long-continued strife
and bloodshed. Such, in fact, is the gist of the chronicles,
and all later documents and events serve to confirm it.
Nevertheless, peace was re-established within the walls for
the nonce, and the policy of Florence remained unaltered.
The partial triumph of the aristocracy had at least one
good effect; inasmuch as the nobles, being satisfied for the
moment, lent efficacious assistance to the Commune, and
enabled all its affairs to be pushed forward more briskly.</p>

<p>In fact, on February 3, 1182, the people of Empoli
were reduced to submission, bound over to pay annual
tribute and to yield military service at the request of the
Florentine Consuls, whether of the Commune or the
Guilds, save in the event of a war against the Counts
<span class="locked">Guidi.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span> The people of Pogna, which was a fief of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
<span class="locked">Alberti,<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span> were the next to make surrender on the
4th of March. And these Pognesi not only pledged
themselves to take the field at the command of the
Florentine Consuls, but to abstain from constructing new
walls or fortresses, either on their own territory or the
neighbouring lands of Semifonte. Also, should others
attempt to fortify those places, they (the Pognesi) were
bound to oppose it and give notice of the fact to the
Florentines, who, on their side, promised friendship and
<span class="locked">protection.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> In the same year the Castle of Montegrossoli
was captured by the <span class="locked">Florentines.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> On July 21,
1184, they made an alliance with the people of Lucca,
who promised to send them yearly a contingent of one
hundred and fifty horse and five hundred foot, for at
least twenty days' service, in all wars waged within
Florentine <span class="locked">territory.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span> In October the Florentines attacked
the Castle of Mangona in the Mugello, but as this fortress
belonged to the Alberti, the latter stirred Pogna to
rebellion, and the Florentines quickly marched against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
that <span class="locked">town.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span> Count Alberti seems to have taken part in
the fight that ensued at Pogna, for it is known that by
November he was in captivity and forced to accept very
hard terms for himself, his wife and his children. He had
to promise to dismantle his fortress of Pogna the following
April, only retaining his own palace and tower; to
demolish the tower of Certaldo, and never rebuild that of
Semifonte. He was to cede to the Florentines whichever
one of the Capraia towers they chose to take; he was to
give them one-half of the ransom or tax to be levied on
all his possessions in general between the Arno and the
Elsa. Finally, as soon as he should be released from
prison ("<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">postquam exiero de prescione</span></i>"), he was pledged to
compel all his men to swear fealty, and to the payment of
four hundred pounds of good Pisan money. His sons
were to reside in Florence two months of the year in time
of war, one month in time of <span class="locked">peace.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span> The subjection and
humiliation of this Count Alberto was a very significant
fact in itself. And when we reflect that it occurred after
Florence had already overthrown the Cadolingi, lowered
the power of the Guidi house, and concluded most favourable
alliances with Pisa, Sienna, and Lucca, it will be easily
seen how quickly the Commune had been able to soar to
a position of very great and almost menacing strength.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>All this certainly contributed no little to hasten the
coming of the Emperor Frederic I., and, in fact, we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
him in Tuscany for the deliberate purpose of reducing the
country to subjection in the year 1185. But he came
without an army, reliant on the might of the Empire, on
his own shrewdness, and his own reputation. He believed
in the possibility of achieving his plans by alienating
some of the Tuscan cities from Florence, and compelling
them to side with the Empire against her. Above all,
he counted upon Pistoia, situated between Lucca and
Florence, and hostile to both; upon Pisa, whom he hoped,
by means of large concessions, to win back to the Imperial
cause, to which she had so often adhered before. He
became still more hopeful of success when, on reaching
San Miniato, in the summer of 1185, many nobles of the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> came to do him homage, with loud complaints of
the oppressive rule of the free cities. On the 25th of
July he emancipated many of these nobles, and some of
their fiefs, from the jurisdiction of <span class="locked">Lucca.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span> On the 31st
of the same month he entered Florence, still surrounded
by nobles of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, who, as Villani says, complained
bitterly of the city, "which had seized their castles, and
thus grossly insulted the <span class="locked">Empire."<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span> Hereupon, the
chroniclers affirm that Frederic deprived Florence of the
right of jurisdiction over her own territory, even just
outside the city walls; and even assert that he adopted
the same measure with regard to all the Tuscan towns,
excepting Pisa and <span class="locked">Pistoia.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span> But this point has been
seriously disputed, many refusing to admit the possibility
of a fact unsupported by any documentary proof. On
the other hand, some writers consider it to be proved by
a later event, the which is not only related by several
chroniclers, but also confirmed by existing documents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
In fact, by a patent dated June 24, 1187, Henry VI.,
in reward, as he expressed it, for services rendered by the
Florentines to his father and himself, granted them judicial
rights over the city and the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> beyond, to the distance
of one mile in the direction of Fiesole, of three towards
Settimo and Campi, and of ten in all other <span class="locked">directions.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span>
Even within these narrow limits, however, the nobles and
soldiery were to be independent of the city. In token of
gratitude for this liberality on the part of the emperor,
the Florentines were bound to present him every year
with a piece of good samite, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">bonum examitum</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> Similar
and equally limited concessions were granted to other
cities <span class="locked">also.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span> Accordingly, some have said, since Henry
restored right of jurisdiction to the Florentines, it is clear
that his father had deprived them of it. In fact, we know
that throughout Tuscany Frederic established Imperial
Podestà, who bore the names of their respective <span class="locked">cities.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Also, reasoning in this style, those writers went so far as
to suppose Florence to have been deprived of judicial
powers even within the city walls. But, as we have seen,
Henry's patent does not speak of restitution&mdash;only of the
liberality shown in rewarding the services of the Florentines,
although it is impossible to understand what those
services could have <span class="locked">been.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span> On the other hand, it is hard
to believe that Florence, who had dared, in weaker times,
to use violent measures against the Imperial envoys, murdering
Rabodo and putting Christian of Mayence to flight,
should now, when so much stronger, and the chief power
in Tuscany, unresistingly submit to deprivation of judicial
rights throughout her own territory, and even within the
city walls. In addition to all this, there seems no doubt
that there were Consuls of Florence during the same
period, and therefore the theory of there being Imperial
Podestà in the city itself naturally falls to the ground.
In fact, the Consuls' names are recorded in documents of
1184. It is true that, for the three following years, the
pseudo Brunetto Latini is the only authority by whom
they are mentioned; but it is difficult to suppose that he
invented them all, or that he could have been mistaken
three consecutive times. Although during these three
years no documents give the names of the Consuls, they
afford, indirectly, continual hints of their <span class="locked">existence.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Hence it is necessary, in my opinion, to begin by
recognising that, according to the ideas and the policy of
Frederic I., there was no question as to his right of
exercising jurisdiction over Tuscany; and that if the cities
had virtually exercised this right without a special grant
to that effect, they had violated thereby the rights of the
emperor, who was accordingly justified in resuming them.
For this end, he had commissioned Reinhold and Christian
to establish Podestà <span class="locked">everywhere,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span> and to restore affairs to
what he deemed their sole legal and normal condition.
Only the difficulty here was not in proving his right,
according to the Imperial theory, but in being able to
enforce it. It was a question of fact, only to be resolved
by force. As we have seen, Imperial Podestà were established
on all sides; and while even in the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> they
could only obtain partial and somewhat contested obedience,
in the greater cities, and particularly in Florence,
they obtained none at all. The <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Potestates Florentiae</span></i>, or
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Florentinorum</span></i>, as of Sienna or the Siennese, whose names so
often occur, are almost invariably&mdash;and in the case of
Florence, one may say quite invariably&mdash;Imperial Podestà,
established in the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, and disputing its jurisdiction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
with the Consuls. Now, seeing that the commune considered
the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> to be its own territory, and therefore
craved the sole command of it, while from the Imperial
point of view city and <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> were equally subject to the
Podestà of the Empire, it naturally followed that these
dignitaries were commonly styled Podestà of Florence or
of the Florentines; and in the same way, Podestà of
Sienna or of the Siennese, of Arezzo or the Aretini, &amp;c.
But, as a matter of fact, they not only failed to command
obedience within the gates of great cities, but even in the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> outside were continually in conflict with the consular
authority. We have already seen what a chaos was
the result. Nevertheless, it seems natural to believe
that the arrival of Frederic I. in Tuscany must have
strengthened immensely the power of these Podestà, and
that, at least for a time, they must have been enabled to
enforce their judicial rights throughout the country, and
to the very gates of the town. This made the chroniclers
assert that the emperor had stripped Florence of its <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>.
It is certain, however, that on his departure things
rapidly lapsed into their previous condition. That is to
say, the consuls did their utmost to neutralise the action
and authority of the Imperial officials. The rise of the
communes had created a new state of things which the
Empire was powerless to destroy, even while refusing to
acknowledge its legal value. Therefore Henry was finally
driven to accord a partial valuation, in the guise of a
generous concession, to an actuality that by this means
he might at least hope to keep within definite limits.</p>

<p>And in reality his patent of 1187 granted Florence
much less than she had possessed for some time before.
If, in fact, the territory of the Commune was not to
extend more than one mile in the direction of Fiesole,
this latter city remained outside the border, although
already subjected to Florence by force of arms, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
with the whole of its <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, which, indeed, as proved by
every treaty, had been incorporated in the Florentine
territory since 1125. Also, as though this were not
enough, Henry declared all nobles within the circumscribed
area left to the city, to be exempted from its
jurisdiction, even including those who had legally and
officially made submission to it. Notwithstanding all
this, Florence found it best to accept the Imperial grant.
Thus things remained practically as before&mdash;that is to say,
the Commune could continue to hold the virtual command,
and snatch as much more as should be possible.
The chronicler Paolino Pieri, in recording this concession,
states that the Florentines regained the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>&mdash;"that is,
they took it back," and by this phrase he unconsciously
defines the real condition of things. Meanwhile, the
Empire yielded the point legally by recognising the
judicial rights of the Consuls within the city and over
part of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> outside. As to the rest, it was
left to be decided, as in the past, by force of arms.
All this serves, in our opinion, to make things clear, and
likewise to explain the inexactitude and confusion of the
chroniclers, who, unable to distinguish between the practical
and legal side of the question, continually jumbled both
together. Undoubtedly it was hard to disentangle them,
seeing that the fact was confronted by two, or rather
three, separate rights, each refusing to acknowledge the
others&mdash;namely, the right of the Empire, that of the
Commune, and, lastly, that of the Pope, whose voice
was always heard repeating&mdash;although always in vain&mdash;that
the Church was Matilda's sole heir.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, the presence in the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> of German
Podestà or counts exercised some influence, even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
indirectly, on the city itself. Or rather, their presence
contributed to modify its constitution by promoting in a
certain way the creation of a new civic magistracy, bearing
their own title. In fact, the Latin term of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">potestas</span></i>,
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">potestà</span></i>, or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">podestà</span></i> was given to every chief authority
during the Middle Ages; even in 1068 it was the title
attributed to Duke Goffredo of Tuscany. Later, it was
bestowed on the German counts governing the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> in
the name of Frederic I. From them it was afterwards
transferred to municipal magistrates. It seems to have
been given first to officials despatched by the Commune
to the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, when this was already occupied by German
counts, in order to imitate and oppose them. At least,
there is reason to believe that certain officials with Italian
names, and bearing the title of Podestà of Florence&mdash;or
of Florentine Podestà&mdash;before any such post had been
created in the city, must have been of this class. Two of
these officials, Renuccio da Stagia and Guerrieri, are known
to us and mentioned more than once in the Rosano
<span class="locked">reports.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span> It seems probable enough that Renuccio may
have been appointed before the year <span class="locked">1180<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span>&mdash;that is, when
there were assuredly Consuls in <span class="locked">Florence.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></span> Hence it is
to be concluded that he held office in the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>. But
whether or no this theory be admissible, it should be
noted that all Florentine documents of the time, when
mentioning the Consuls, always add the words: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sive
Rector vel Potestas, vel Dominator.</span>" At first it is merely
a generic formula, vaguely suggesting the possibility of
another magistrature. But little by little the formula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
assumes a more concrete character; the term <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Potestas</span></i>
becoming of so much more importance, as to often precede
that of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consules</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> Then, the new office is on the
point of birth; and finally, in 1193, makes its appearance
in the person of Gherardo Caponsacchi, a Florentine
belonging to a consular family.</p>

<p>Ammirato was mistaken in thinking that there had been
a magistrate of this kind in the year 1184, because he found
that the treaty of alliance between Florence and Lucca
mentioned no individual in particular, but made a general
allusion to the office of Podestà.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> As we have observed,
however, too many similar allusions occur in State papers,
even when Florence was certainly ruled by Consuls, to
allow us to draw the same conclusion. It may be that
Florence had a Podestà even earlier than 1193, but until
we find some document specifying the name of a person
filling that office, we cannot venture to assert it as a fact.</p>

<p>At any rate, the institution of the new magistracy was
preceded by an increased influx of nobles within the city
walls. This, indeed, was one of the chief causes of the
change. Continual proofs to this effect are afforded by
contemporary documents, and confirmed by the narratives
of the chroniclers. The pseudo Brunetto Latini tells us
that in 1192 the Consuls included "Messer Tegrino of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
the Counts Guidi, 'paladin' in Florence, and Chianni de'
Fifanti." Now, to find a count and count palatine or
paladine among the Florentine Consuls is an absolutely
new thing. The same writer also says that in the same
year "a decree was issued in Florence that the Counts
Guidi and the Counts Alberti and the Counts da Certaldo,
Ubaldini et Figiovanni, Pazzi and Ubertini, the Counts of
Panago, and many other nobles, being citizens, were to
dwell in the city of Florence during four months of the
year." However much or little value this chronicler
may have, his statement agrees with the information found
in documents, and explains the origin of the new magistrature.
Assuredly the nobles cannot have relished being
subject to the popular consular government, against which
they had struggled since the year 1177, and must have
particularly disliked being under the jurisdiction of persons
they deemed their inferiors in rank and dignity. Besides,
as the elements composing the mass of the citizens became
more heterogeneous, thus increasing the danger of civil
war, so much the more the possibility of being judged by
their political adversaries must have seemed unbearable to
them. Hence the need was felt of a new magistrature of
a different and, preferably, of an aristocratic character,
and an Imperial institution, such as that of the Podestà,
was chosen for a model. The holder of this office is no
mere judge, as many believed and recorded; he is the positive
head and representative of the Commune; he signs
treaties, commands the army, and fills the place of the
Consuls.</p>

<p>In fact, when on July 14, 1193, the Castle of Trebbio
made submission to Florence, the Commune was officially
represented by Gherardo Caponsacchi <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Potestas Florentie et
eius consiliarii</span></i>, together with the seven rectors of the
headships (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Capitudini</span></i>) of the <span class="locked">guilds.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span> The councillors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
whose names are inserted in the document, are likewise
seven, and almost all of consular houses; two, indeed, are
nobles&mdash;namely, a Count Arrigo (perhaps of Capraia)
and a Tegghiaio Bundelmonti. It seems certain that
Consuls were again chosen in 1194, since the pseudo
Brunetto Latini names two, one of whom was an Uberti.
In 1195 a Podestà reappears in the person of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rainerius
de Gaetano, cum suis consiliariis</span></i>, among whom a <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consul
iustitiae</span></i> is <span class="locked">included.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span> It may be considered a certainty
that these councillors, whose number is continually varying
in the documents, were no other than the Consuls, who
survived in this transitory form for some time, with the
Podestà as their chief. Together with him they represent
the Commune, sometimes even without him. But by
degrees their importance diminishes, while that of the
Podestà is increased. In short, there is a period of transformation
during which the new, and as yet, ill-defined
form of government alternates with that of the Consuls.</p>

<p>In 1200 the Podestà is no longer a Florentine, but a
foreigner, and already represents the government, unaided
by councillors, who have disappeared altogether in 1207&mdash;namely,
when the government has assumed its definite
shape. Or, to express it more accurately, their function
was continually changed and their number increased, until
they were converted into a special council of the whole
city, beside the ancient council or senate that was
changed into a general council. On arriving at that
time we shall find the government represented by the
Podestà and two councils, sitting either separately or
jointly, and styled in the latter case the general and
special council. Thus the consular office may be considered
to have been altogether extinguished. In fact,
excepting one final attempt in 1211 and 1212, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Consuls were once more elected, we never meet with them
again. What we have related will make it easier to
understand why the chroniclers attribute the origin of the
Podestà to various dates. The pseudo Brunetto Latini
makes the office begin in 1200&mdash;namely, the year when it
was first held by a foreigner, and alien birth considered an
indispensable qualification for the post. Therefore, before
that time, the chronicler seems to regard the Podestà
chiefly as a head <span class="locked">Consul.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span> We can also understand why
Villani, on the contrary, should have dated the origin of
the office from 1207. This, in fact, was the year in
which it assumed a really definite shape, since the Podestà
was not only a foreigner, but appears unescorted by
councillors. Nevertheless, Villani makes a mistake in
representing him as a magistrate chosen for the sole purpose
of administering justice more impartially, and in
adding that "the signory of the Consuls did not cease
then, inasmuch as they continued to hold power over all
other affairs of the Commune." He makes two blunders
here, but the second is little more than a simple anachronism.
In fact, although his statement cannot be
true as regards 1207, it may have been at least partially
true with reference to the preceding years, when the
Consuls still survived their own decease, as it were, in the
guise of councillors to the Podestà.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>It is certain that there was a recurrence of consular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
government between 1196 and <span class="locked">1199.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span> But just at that
time an event of considerable importance worked a
radical change in the general policy of Tuscany, and
is accordingly worthy of notice. The Emperor Frederic
I. died on September 27, 1197, and his death led first
to the abandonment and then to the total ruin of the
Imperial system he had so persistently striven to establish
throughout central Italy. The people of San Miniato
destroyed the fortress held by the Germans, and
subsequently the walls of St. <span class="locked">Genesio.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span> The Florentines
bought back the Castle of Montegrossoli, which had
been re-occupied and fortified by nobles, who proved very
<span class="locked">troublesome.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span> After this Florence set a greater undertaking
on foot, by forming a league of the Tuscan cities
against the Empire. It was finally arranged at St. Genesio
on November 11, 1197, when first the Lucchese, and then
the Florentines, Siennese, the people of San Miniato, and
the Bishop of Volterra made oath to maintain it, and the
solemnity of the occasion was enhanced by the presence
of two cardinals of the Church. The main terms of the
treaty were, an alliance for the common defence against
all opponents of the League, and a pledge that neither
peace nor truce should be made "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">cum aliquo Imperatore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
vel Rege seu Principe, Duce vel Marchione</span>," without the
consent of the Rectors of the said League. It was also
agreed to attack all cities, towns, counts, or bishops refusing
to join the alliance when requested so to <span class="locked">do.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span> What
was the pressing danger? Why this alliance against the
Empire at the moment when it was no longer a source of
alarm? There is one stipulation that best explains the
real object in view. It is to the effect that castles, towns,
and small domains were only to be admitted to the League
as dependents of the legitimate owners of the territory
whereon these castles or domains might be situated; but a
single exception was made in favour of <span class="locked">Poggibonsi,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span>
because its dominion was disputed by many claimants.
Montepulciano was to be admitted as a dependence of
Sienna whenever that city should be able to prove its right
of dominion.</p>

<p>It seems clear from all this that the genuine purpose
of the League was to take advantage of the emperor's
decease in order to secure to the cities the complete
possession of their respective territories. To this end
it was necessary that Tuscany should be united, and consequently
adherence to the League was to be, as far as
possible, obligatory. Its subsequent documents leave no
doubt as to the true aim in view; indeed, they furnish
very ample proof that Florence had promoted the League,
in order that all Tuscany might aid her to regain speedy
possession of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>. But, although the League was
against the Empire, it was by no means intended for the
defence of the Pope, since it utterly disregarded his pretensions
to Matilda's inheritance. For refusing to recognise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
any emperor, king, duke, or margrave, without the
approval of the Roman Church, a proviso was added
showing that should the Pope desire to join the League,
he must accept its terms in order to win admittance.
Should he request assistance to reconquer his own territories,
everything was to be done according to the orders of the
Rectors of the League. But should the territory he wished
to reconquer be already in the hands of the communes, or
of any of the allied cities, the League could afford him
no help. It was impossible to speak more clearly. Accordingly,
when Innocent III. became Pope, early in 1198,
we soon find him manifesting much disapproval of the
conduct of the League, in spite of being adverse to the
Empire and favourable to the national Italian spirit.</p>

<p>At Castel Fiorentino, on December 4, 1197, the
Rectors of the League were sworn in. First among them
were the Bishop of Volterra and the Florentine Consul
Acerbo, who was practically the head, although that title
was accorded to the bishop by reason of his ecclesiastical
rank. For the moment Pisa and Pistoia held back; but
these and other Tuscan cities had retained the right of
adhering to the <span class="locked">League.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span> Arezzo had already joined on
the 2nd of December, Count Guido gave his oath on
February 5, 1198, and Count Alberto on the seventh of
the same month. Nevertheless, in signing the second
of these two treaties, the Florentines expressly reserved
their right to attach Semifonte, and procure the submission
of the Alberti estates of Certaldo and Mangone, even by
force if <span class="locked">required.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span> Thus many other adhesions were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
obtained by means of stipulations virtually implying acts
of submission to Florence.</p>

<p>This was the moment chosen by the newly elected Pope
Innocent, soon after his consecration in the same month of
February, to write to the two cardinals who had witnessed
the oath to the League, stating that on many points he
considered the said treaty "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">nec utilitatem contineat, nec
sapiat honestatem</span>," inasmuch as it neglected the fact of the
Duchy of Tuscany appertaining to the Church, "ad ius et
dominium Ecclesiae Romanae pertineat." He intended,
therefore, to enforce his rights. If the members of the
League submitted to him, he would compel the Pisans,
under threat of interdict, to likewise join them against
the Empire; otherwise he would leave them at liberty to
do as they <span class="locked">chose.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></span> But as no attention was paid to him,
he had to make a virtue of necessity and considerably
lower his <span class="locked">tone.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span> Some slight concessions, though of what
nature is unknown, seem, however, to have been made to
him, for afterwards, when writing to the Pisans, he
appeared to be better satisfied, and urged them to join
the League. It is, however, certain that they persisted in
their refusal, and although the Pope, grown shrewder by
experience, afterwards became a declared and energetic
champion of the League against the Empire, this fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
only availed to augment his moral and political influence,
without winning him a single handsbreadth of territory, or
enabling him to enforce any one of his pretended rights
over Tuscany. The Florentines, on the contrary, profited
more and more by this state of things. On April 10,
1198, Figline entered the League, not only made
submission to Florence, but paid a yearly tribute <span class="locked">also<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span>;
and on the 11th of May Certaldo agreed to identical
<span class="locked">terms.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span> The Republic persevered in the course it had
marked out with equal shrewdness and energy. It
allowed the nobles to take an increasing part in the
government, so as to secure their hearty co-operation
in achieving the aim it had in view. The same Count
Arrigo da Capraia, who in 1193 was on the council
of Podestà Caponsacchi, was actually promoted to the
consulship in <span class="locked">1199.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span> Finally, in 1200, a foreigner was
elected Podestà,<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> in the person of Paganello Porcari of
Lucca, a measure that, as we have already noted, the
nobles had long desired to carry out. And as Porcari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
showed energy and daring in the conduct of the war
he was again chosen the following year. Then, in
February, 1201, Count Alberto made oath to cede the
height of Semifonte, with its fortress and walls, to the
Florentines; and to assist them, whenever required, to
gain possession of Colle, Certaldo, and the town of <span class="locked">Semifonte.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span>
The Bishop of Volterra likewise made oath to
assist them in these <span class="locked">campaigns.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> All this seemed to come
about as an inherent consequence of the terms of the
League, and before long the allies, finding themselves
reduced to serve the interests of Florence alone, naturally
began to show signs of weariness and suspicion. But,
heedless of all else, the Commune made ready for the
expedition against Semifonte, for which all these treaties
had paved the way.</p>

<p>Florence had long contemplated the seizure of that
stronghold, for, owing to its strategic advantages and the
ease with which the position could be reinforced by
friendly neighbours, it had been a thorn in her side.
Accordingly the now haughty Republic determined to
make an end of it. We have already related how in
1184 Count Alberto had been compelled to accept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
same terms exacted from the people of Pogna in 1182&mdash;namely,
to give his solemn promise to build no defences.
Nevertheless, profiting by the arrival of Frederic I. and
the difficulties in which Florence was then involved, he
had presently erected the Castle of Semifonte on the
Petrognano rock, and Florence had never forgiven this
offence. He had also assumed the title of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Comes de
Summofonte</span></i>. Near the castle a town had sprung up, and,
as many sought refuge there from neighbouring places
conquered and taxed by Florence, its population had
rapidly increased. Indeed there was already this rhyme
afloat in the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container" xml:lang="it" lang="it">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Firenze, fatti in là,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Che Semifonte si fa città."<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>It was for these reasons that the Republic so persistently
tried to secure pledges of help from its neighbours by the
numerous treaties to which reference has been made, and
likewise by others concluded through the efforts of the
energetic Podestà. But Sienna had still to be reckoned
with, and Sienna might do good service to the hostile
Alberto, who was already prepared for defence. Accordingly
the Florentines signed an alliance with that state
on March 29, 1201, promising their aid against Montalcino,
which showed as threatening a front to Sienna as the
Semifonte position towards their own <span class="locked">city.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span> Also Colle
was made to swear to accord no help to the people of
<span class="locked">Semifonte.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span> Thereupon the war finally began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
The chronicler Sanzanome, who witnessed it, declares,
with his habitual exaggeration, that it lasted five years,
but he may have counted in all the preliminary <span class="locked">skirmishes.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span>
At any rate, it was a hard struggle, for, treaties notwithstanding,
Semifonte received help from all its neighbours,
whose jealous dread of Florence had considerably increased.
Then, too, owing to the strength of its position and the
ability of Scoto, its valiant Podestà, the castle opposed so
vigorous a resistance to the beleaguring army surrounding
it on all sides, that the Florentines, seeing no hope of
winning it by force, called treason to their aid. A certain
Gonella, with some other fugitives, escaped from an
adjoining territory, had taken refuge in the castle, and
been entrusted with the defence of the Bagnuolo tower.
This man made use of his post to betray the place to the
enemy. But at the moment that he and his comrades
were in the act of opening the gate, the defenders of Semifonte
fell on them with fury and killed them all. Nevertheless,
the evil deed had done its work, for Semifonte
was speedily forced to surrender. Even if this was not
brought about by treason alone, as Villani asserts (v. 30),
the betrayal of the tower undoubtedly contributed to that
result. In fact, on February 20, 1202, the Consuls, then
returned to office in Florence, granted a perpetual exemption
from all dues or taxes to the descendants of Gonella
and his companions fallen in the cause of the <span class="locked">Republic.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span>
The same year, on the 3rd of April, the terms of the
castle's surrender were subscribed and sworn. The Florentines
assured pardon, protection, and the return of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
prisoners to the people of Semifonte, but the latter were
bound to demolish their fortress and walls; were to
desert the hill and settle in the plain; and all save the
soldiery and the churches were to pay a yearly tax of
twenty-six <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">denari</span></i> on every <span class="locked">hearth.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span></p>

<p>The Pope expostulated strongly with the Florentines
for their cruelty towards Semifonte, but after sending him
a letter of justification in reply, the Consuls continued to
follow their own course, and picked a quarrel with the
<span class="locked">Siennese.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span> The point of dispute was the Castle of Tornano,
in the Paterno valley. Florence wished to get
possession of it, and the Siennese declared that it was not
theirs to give, seeing that it was the property of independent
lords. Thereupon the Florentines set to work
in their usual way, by persuading Montepulciano, a large
town belonging to Sienna, to swear submission to them,
and also promise an annual <span class="locked">tribute.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></span> Accordingly, war
would have broken out at once, but for the intervention
of Ogerio, the Podestà of Poggibonsi. Being accepted as
arbiter, he carefully studied the question of border lines,
and conscientiously defined them. His verdict was given
on June 4, <span class="locked">1203.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></span> According to the boundaries traced
by Ogerio, Florence retained the whole of the Fiesolan
and Florentine <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, and the valley of Paterno was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
comprised in these limits. The Siennese were to do their
best to persuade the lords of the castle to cede that as
well. Both sides agreed to this <span class="locked">arrangement;<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span> it was
scrupulously respected by the Siennese, and on May 15,
1204, it was sanctioned by Pope Innocent III., at the
express desire of the <span class="locked">Florentines.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></span> Nevertheless, the
latter continued their secret practices with Montepulciano,
and on the 30th and 31st of May induced that town to
renew its oath of offensive and defensive alliance against
<span class="locked">Sienna.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></span> As soon as this became known, there were fresh
complaints, fresh protests from the Siennese. They brought
the affair before the League, and the Rectors of the same
were expressly assembled at San Quirico di Osenna,
April 5, 1205, under the presidency of the Bishop of
Volterra, the Florentines and Aretines having declined to
appear. By the examination of witnesses, it was clearly
proved that Montepulciano appertained to the <span class="locked">Siennese.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></span>
We do not know whether the verdict was then pronounced,
nor do we know the final result of the quarrel. But it
seems clear that from this moment the League was
virtually dissolved, and by the act of the Florentines, its
original initiators. Their primary object was now achieved
in the main, and henceforth they could expect nothing
from their allies save impediments to the fulfilment of
their ulterior designs. For, more or less, all distrusted
their ambition, and were tired of playing the part of
passive tools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
But the Florentine Consuls allowed nothing to check
their course of action, and quarrelled next with the Counts
of Capraia owning a castle of the same name on the
right bank of the Arno, near the Pistoian frontier. In
conjunction with the Pistoiese, these nobles could easily
bar the Arno against the Florentines. Accordingly,
before this, in 1203, the latter had deemed it well to
erect another castle on the opposite bank at a place called
Malborghetto. The very significant name of Montelupo
that they gave to the new building was sufficiently
expressive of its purpose. In fact, men already repeated
the saying, "To destroy this goat, there needs a <span class="locked">wolf."<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span>
This affair also would have provoked strife had not the
Florentines, with their accustomed diplomatic subtlety,
profited by the friendly offices of the Lucchese to turn it
to their own advantage, and avoid coming to blows. In
fact, a treaty was arranged in June, 1204, by which
Florence was bound to leave the right bank of the river
unmolested, and the Counts of Capraia to respect the
left bank of the <span class="locked">same.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></span> And before long the count
decided to swear alliance and fealty to the Florentines,
together with his dependents, all of whom, excepting the
soldiery, became subject to a yearly hearth tax of twenty-six
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">denari</span></i>. He also ceded his castle and other possessions
on the left side of the Arno, near Montelupo, being
likewise pledged to the defence of this <span class="locked">fort.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
According to the pseudo <span class="locked">Brunetto,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></span> and one of the old
lists of Consuls, although with no documentary evidence of
the fact, Count Rodolfo, son of Count Guido di Capraia,
became Podestà of Florence in 1205. Now, if this be
true, it must be concluded that his nomination had been
also stipulated in the <span class="locked">treaty.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span> In the ensuing year the
consular government seems to have been resumed, but in
1207 we come at last to the genuine Podestà of foreign
birth, in the shape of Gualfredotto Grasselli of Milan, who
henceforth represented the Commune without requiring
the assistance of his <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">consiliarii</span></i>. Grasselli, too, was re-elected
the following year, to enable him to carry on the
campaigns the Florentines had planned with so much
ardour some time before. An occasion for renewing
hostilities was not long delayed. The Montepulciano
question had become angrier; and accordingly the Siennese,
considering that territory to be theirs by right, resolved to
attack it. In the certainty of being reinforced, Montepulciano
made a most obstinate defence; and the Florentines,
after waiting awhile, also recurred to arms in 1207.
In co-operation with Lombard, Romagnol, and Aretine
allies, they marched with their <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i> to the assault of
the Castle of Montalto della Berardenga, between the rivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Ambra and Ombrone, which the Siennese had guarded on
all sides with their Pistoian, Lucchese, and Orvietan
friends. These were all routed on the 20th of June,
leaving many prisoners in the enemy's hands. According
to Paolino Pieri the number taken was 1,254. The
castle was destroyed, but the war went on, notwithstanding
the Pope's efforts to bring about a peace. The Florentines
then made a furious attack on the Castle of Rigomagno,
and when the scaling ladders broke down they climbed
on one another's shoulders and thus won the walls. The
capture of this stronghold made them masters of the
Ombrone <span class="locked">valley.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></span> Thereupon (February, 1208) the
Siennese were forced to accept peace on very hard
terms. By the treaty concluded between the 13th and
20th of <span class="locked">October,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></span> they were pledged to yield all their
possessions at Poggibonsi, to cede Tornano and its tower,
to observe the boundaries adjudged by Ogerio, in every
direction, and to leave Montepulciano unmolested. The
prisoners on either side were exchanged.</p>

<p>But this war already betokens the advent of a new
period in Florentine history. The conquest of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>
was no longer in question, for the Republic already possessed
it in full. With the growing prosperity born of its
numerous victories, the city had now to open roads for its
vast commerce. It was not only the vagueness of their
respective frontiers and the wish to enlarge them that
caused Sienna and Florence to be continually at strife; it
was their commercial rivalry in the markets of Italy, and
especially as regarded the trade with Rome; this near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
neighbour having become, through the widespread relations
of the Church, the principal centre of financial affairs
in the civilised world. For some time past it had been
the aim of Florence to obtain a monopoly of these affairs,
and this was one reason why she had always adhered to
the Guelphs. She had had frequent disputes with Arezzo,
Volterra, and above all with Sienna, as being the most
powerful city on the road to Rome. So the two rivals
were perpetually stirred to fresh and fiercer strife. So, too,
before long, the irresistible need of Florence for free communication
with the sea became the chief cause of her
equally long and sanguinary wars with Pisa, the city
barring her way to the coast. But as this conflict had
not yet begun, the subject will be resumed in due time.
In fact, the peace of Sienna was followed by some years of
truce with foreign foes, although there was little peace
within the city, where the seeds of civil war were already
on the point of bursting forth.</p>

<p>The foreign Podestà, unattended and unchecked by the
former councillor-consuls, as they might be called, has now
become a settled institution; and, save for their brief
re-establishment during 1211 and 1212, the Consuls, as
already related, have vanished for ever. This was
undeniably a triumph for the patricians, to whom the
working people had bent for the nonce, in order to secure
their co-operation in the difficult task of reducing the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> to submission. The achievement of this conquest
gave an extraordinary impulse to trade, and by opening an
increasingly wide field for commercial enterprise, induced
the desire to develop it still more. Hence, it was not to
be expected that a republic whose prosperity and strength
were wholly based on its industry and commerce, could or
would be satisfied, in the long run, with a government
suited to nobles, whose constant tendency was to grow
stronger, haughtier, and more overbearing. From this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
moment, therefore, a struggle between the people and the
patricians (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>) was inevitable. The long series of
civil wars, lacerating the city and staining its stones with
blood, is in fact on the point of beginning.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div><img src="images/i_a.jpg" class="drop-capi" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">AFTER</span> the office of Podestà had been
permanently established in 1207, its
main favourers and promoters, the aristocrats,
became more daring, and forming
a military organisation, of which the
Podestà was the head, took a more
active part in all wars abroad. Everything seemed progressing
rapidly and well, when the Buondelmonti affair
in 1215 caused an outbreak of civil war. Dissension was
already lurking among certain of the nobles, and particularly
between the Buondelmonti on the one hand, the
Uberti and Fifanti on the other, either side numbering
many adherents. Accordingly, in the hope of pacifying the
dispute, a marriage was arranged between Bundelmonte
Buondelmonti and a maiden of the Amidei house. But
when all the preliminaries were concluded, the wife of
Forese Donati called Buondelmonti to her and said: "Oh!
shameful knight, to take to wife a woman of the Uberti and
Fifanti. 'Twere better and worthier to choose this bride."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
So saying, she pointed to her own daughter. Buondelmonti
accepted the offer, and, forsaking his betrothed, speedily
married the girl. Thereupon the kinsfolk and friends
of the deserted maiden assembled in the Amidei palace
and vowed to avenge her wrongs. It was then that Mosca
Lamberti turned to those charged to execute revenge,
saying, "Whoever deals a light blow or wound, may
prepare for his own grave." And then, to show that the
quarrel was to the death, he added the memorable words:
"Once done, 'tis done with" ("<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Cosa fatta, capo ha</span></i>").
So bloodshed was ordained.</p>

<p>It was the Easter Day of 1215. The handsome young
knight Buondelmonti, elegantly attired and with a wreath
on his head, mounted his white horse and crossed from
Oltrarno by the old bridge. He had reached the statue
of Mars, when he was suddenly attacked. Schiatta degli
Uberti hurled him to the ground with a blow from his
mace, and the other conspirators quickly fell upon him
and severed his veins with their knives. Afterwards
the corpse was placed on a bier, the bride supporting the
head of her murdered husband, and both carried in
procession round the city, to move men to fresh deeds of
hatred and <span class="locked">revenge.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></span> And this was the beginning of the
series of internecine wars, from which many chroniclers
date the origin of the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in
Florence. No modern historian, however, will be apt to
attribute so vast an importance to a private feud, nor to
believe that a breach of promise to an Amidei maiden
could be the real primary cause of the party strife that
from the year 1177 had already more than once drenched
the city in blood. Even Villani, although considering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Buondelmonti affair to be the origin of the Guelphs and
Ghibellines, is careful to add: "Nevertheless, long before
this, the noble citizens had split into sects and into the
said parties, by reason of the quarrels and disputes between
the Church and the <span class="locked">Empire."<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></span> The Buondelmonti
catastrophe, with all the private enmities it involved,
undoubtedly served to inflame the political passions of
two already existent parties, which now, in the days of
Frederic II., acquired a political importance of a far wider
nature by their connection with the general affairs of Italy.
It was only then that the parties in Florence assumed the
German appellations of Guelphs and Ghibellines. Also, it
is worthy of remark that July, 1215, was the date of the
second Frederic's state progress to Aix la Chapelle, to be
crowned king of Germany, a fact of some significance, as
regards the history of parties in Italy. This may easily
explain why the chroniclers should have attributed to the
Buondelmonti tragedy, occurring in the same year, the
origin of the Guelphs and Ghibellines. The names began
then it is true, but the parties were of older date.</p>

<p>Villani's Chronicle (v. 39) now gives a list of the principal
Guelph and Ghibelline families, showing that the
majority of the older houses was almost invariably Ghibellines,
whereas the Guelph party included many "of no great
antiquity," but "already beginning to be powerful."
Later on, when the Ghibellines are destroyed, we shall
find the Guelph nobles merged in the party of the well-to-do
burghers (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolo grasso</span></i>). At present these patricians,
being hostile to the Uberti, begin to make advances to
newly enriched families, and even to the people, by siding
with the Church. Fortunately Pope Innocent III. started
a Crusade at this time, and thus many powerful Florentines
went to the East and employed their fighting powers in a
better cause. At the siege of Damietta, in fact, they distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
themselves greatly: Bonaguisa dei Bonaguisi
the first to scale the walls, planted the banner of the
Republic beside the Christian flag. In Giovanni Villani's
time this banner was still preserved and held in the
greatest honour.</p>

<p>In 1218 Florence resumed hostilities in the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>,
and by 1220 had subdued various castles and domains,
and exacted oaths of fealty from all defeated foes. But
immediately afterwards a far graver war broke out with
Pisa. The jealousy of the two rival republics was always
on the increase, and for some time past each had struggled
against the other for absolute commercial supremacy in
Tuscany. Pisa commanded the sea, Florence the mainland,
therefore each city required the other's help.
Hence, in spite of repeated agreements and treaties,
their mutual jealousy remained undiminished. The Florentines
adhered steadfastly to the Church; the Pisans to
the Empire. Things had gradually become inflamed to
so high a pitch that the smallest trifle was enough to
excite war, or rather to provoke the endless series of
wars destined to change the character of the Tuscan
factions.</p>

<p>In fact, the first pretext for strife, at least as related
by Villani (vi. 2), is futile to the point of utter
absurdity. Many ambassadors attended the coronation
of the Emperor Frederic II. in Rome (1220), and among
them, says the chronicler, were those of Pisa and Florence,
who had long eyed one another with distrust. It chanced
that one of the Florentine ambassadors, while feasting
with a cardinal, begged the gift of a certain very beautiful
dog, and his host promised to grant it. The next day
the cardinal entertained the Pisans, and one of them,
happening to make the same request, the animal was
promised likewise to him. But the Florentine, being the
first to send for the dog, he actually obtained it. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
led to quarrels and violence, not only on the part of the
ambassadors and their trains, but also between all the
Pisans and Florentines in Rome at the time. We can
hardly assign any historical value to this tale; but it
shows that the amount of ill-feeling between the rival
states rendered any trifle a sufficient pretext for bloodshed.
The real fact, even according to the testimony of
Sanzanome, is that Pisans and Florentines came to blows
in Rome. The Pisans were the assailants, but had the
worst of the bout. There was great wrath in Pisa at the
news of the riot, and as a speedy reprisal all Florentine
merchandise in the town was made confiscate. Florence
then seems to have done her utmost to avoid open war,
but to no purpose. Preparations went on for some time
on either side, and then in 1222, when war had burst
forth between the Lucchese and Pisans, the Florentines
profited by the opportunity to attack the latter near Castel
del Bosco, defeated them, and, according to the chroniclers,
carried off thirteen hundred prisoners. Other attacks
ensued, and various small castles were captured between
this time and 1228, when we see the Florentines engaged
in more serious strife with the Pistoians, and reducing
them to accept their terms. It is in 1228 that we find
the first mention of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i> on a Florentine <span class="locked">battle-field.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span>
The Milanese had been the first to use the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i>, but in course of time, and with slight modifications,
the custom had been adopted by the other Italian
cities, who, with increasing wars and larger forces, recognised
the need of a rallying point in their midst. The
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i> was a chariot drawn by oxen with scarlet
trappings and surmounted by two lofty poles bearing the
great banner of the Republic, swinging its red and white
folds on high. Behind, on a smaller car, came the bell,
called the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Martinella</span></i>, to ring out military orders. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
some time before a war was proclaimed the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Martinella</span></i>
was attached to the door of Sta Maria in the New
Market, and rung there to warn both citizens and
enemies to make ready for action. The <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i> was
always surrounded by a guard of picked men; its surrender
was considered as the final defeat and humiliation
of the army.</p>

<p>Another prolonged and sanguinary conflict with Sienna
was undertaken and resumed almost yearly from 1227 to
1235. The Siennese suffered severe losses, but were able
to seize Montepulciano, demolish its towers and ramparts,
and do some damage to Montalcino, which had
joined alliance with the Florentines. The latter, however,
not only devastated the Siennese <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> time after time,
and captured a large number of prisoners, but also besieged
the hostile capital, and although failing to win it,
pressed close enough to the walls to hurl donkeys over
them with catapults, to prove their contempt for the
town. Finally, through the mediation of the Pope, peace
was concluded very advantageously for Florence. The
Siennese had to forfeit a large sum of money for the rebuilding
of the walls and towers of Montepulciano, were
sworn to leave that territory for ever unmolested, and
likewise compelled to repair the castle of Montalcino, at
the pleasure of the Florentines, who still retained their
hold on Poggibonsi.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Thus, throughout all these wars, in which the influence
of Pope and emperor was felt on this or the other side,
we are enabled to trace the gradual formation of parties
in Tuscany, and to witness the process by which the
political and commercial supremacy of Florence was built
up. Her present rivals, Sienna and Pisa, both adhere to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the Empire; whereas Florence clings more and more
closely to the Church. Pisa shuts her out from the sea:
hence the origin of their mutual rivalry and continual
strife. How, indeed, could war be avoided, when the
commercial power of Florence felt the increasingly imperative
need of free access to the coast? Sienna, on the
other hand, competed with Florence by trying to get all
the affairs of the Roman <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">curia</span></i> into the hands of its own
bankers, those affairs being so numerous and lucrative as
to enrich all concerned with them. These continual
jealousies invariably urged Pisa and Sienna to favour the
Empire. Lucca, as the rival of Pisa, inclined towards
Florence, and became Guelph. Pistoia, planted between
two Guelph cities, and continually menaced by them,
naturally adopted the Ghibelline cause. Thus, the
division of parties in Tuscany afterwards reacted on the
formation of Florentine sects, and as the latter began to
assume a more general character, through the growing
influence of Frederic II. in Italy, they adopted the
German names of Guelphs and Ghibellines. The Florentine
Republic, having triumphed over Pisa, Sienna, and
Pistoia, was virtually the chief power in Tuscany; but
had one danger to face, in the possible augmentation of
Frederic's power. Frederic II. was the enemy of the
Pope, who had excommunicated him, and of all Guelphs!
He had gone away for a time to lead the Crusade in the
East; was now in Germany engaged in a struggle with
his rebellious son, and all this had greatly advanced the
fortunes of Florence. But he was about to return to
Italy, and his presence might again embolden the foes of
the Republic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, under the rule of successive Podestà,
Florence had prospered in war, and devoted times of
peace to internal organisation and embellishment. At
the instance of the Podestà Torello da Strada (1233) all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the male inhabitants of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> were summoned to
inscribe their names and specify their condition, whether
freemen, serfs, or dependents, with a view to ascertaining
the real state of the population and providing for its
better government. In 1237&ndash;38 the Podestà Rubaconte
da Mandello built a new bridge over the Arno, which
was first designated by his own name of Rubaconte, and
afterwards as the Ponte alle Grazie, in honour of an
adjoining church. It was also by order of the same
Podestà that all the streets of Florence were first paved,
and other works completed for the improvement of the
public health, or the decoration of the city. Thus a
magistrate originally appointed&mdash;according to the chroniclers&mdash;to
do the work of an ordinary judge is seen
gradually fulfilling the functions of the head of the
Republic. And the patricians over whom he presided
daily rose to greater power and daring, and particularly
when the arrival of Frederic II. began to encourage the
Ghibelline party throughout Italy. In fact, when Brescia
was besieged by the Ghibellines in 1237, we find many
Florentine nobles in their camp. Every day brought
fresh proofs that the emperor might count on many
friends and much assistance from Florence. Consequently
numerous riots took place, for the Guelph nobles offered
violent opposition and joined with the people, which was
entirely <span class="locked">Guelph.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></span> In 1240 we find that three citizens
were nominated to collect funds in aid of the Imperial
army: surely a strange proceeding in a <span class="locked">republic<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></span> where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the mass of the population was thoroughly Guelph! But
it is not surprising that such events should have inevitably
caused a reaction.</p>

<p>Already in 1246 Frederic II. had appointed his natural
son, Frederic of Antioch, vicar-general of Tuscany, and
also sent other vicars to Florence to fill the office of
Podestà. This aroused discontent on the part of the
Guelph nobles, who wished their own faction to regain
the upper hand in the city. About this time, 1247,
Frederic was in <span class="locked">Lombardy,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></span> and at almost open war with
the Pope, who continued to launch excommunications at
him, deprived him of the Imperial title, and stirred
enemies from all sides against him. Accordingly,
Frederic sent messengers to the Uberti in Florence,
advising them that the moment had come for them to
assume the government of Florence. Provided they had
the courage to fly to arms, his succour would not be long
delayed. The Uberti were not deaf to his words. The
heads of the chief Ghibelline houses met in council and
decided on immediate resort to violence. There was
instant division in the city; the Ghibelline aristocracy
on one side, the Guelph nobles, with all the people on the
other; and the alarm bell was pealed. Fighting went on
from street to street, by day and by night, behind barricades,
from tower-roofs, and with catapults, rams, and
other engines of war. As the popular excitement
increased the strife became general. The Ghibellines
had the advantage of superior military training; they
were confident of receiving reinforcements; and, massed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
under one leader, took all their orders from the Uberti
palaces. The people, on the contrary, fought at random,
and were soon surrounded and repulsed. Nevertheless,
at one moment their very defeat seemed about to win
them the victory. Hard-pressed on all sides, they were
gradually driven back towards the chain barricades
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">serraglio</span></i>) of the Bagnesi and Guidalotti mansions; and
being massed about this defence, fought so vigorously as
almost to regain their former position. But just then the
Imperial contingent appeared on the scene, and all was
lost. The vicar-general Frederic, son of the emperor,
entered Florence at the head of sixteen hundred German
knights, and made furious charges on the people. The
latter opposed a sturdy resistance, prolonging the fight for
three days, but it was a vain struggle. The Ghibellines
were victorious on all sides, and the emperor could have
sent fresh reinforcements if required. One of the most
valiant of the Guelphs, Rustico Marignolli, who had borne
the standard of the people throughout the mêlée, fell
wounded to the death by a shot in the face from a crossbow.
Thereupon the leaders of the party finally decided
to surrender and fly into exile on Candlemas night
(February 2, 1249). All those resolved on flight gathered
together fully armed, and taking possession of Marignolli's
corpse, bore it away in a solemn procession with
a crowd of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i>, and a great show of weapons and
torches, to celebrate the funeral at San Lorenzo by night.
The bier was carried on the shoulders of the worthiest
cavaliers, and the defeated but not dishonoured banner
hung trailing from it to the ground. The whole function
resembled a pact of vengeance sworn on the body of the
dead warrior rather than a mere burial ceremony.</p>

<p>After this the leading Guelphs fled the city and took
refuge in neighbouring castles; the same in fact from which,
at the cost of much blood, they had once ousted the feudal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
lords. These latter, having been compelled to settle in the
town, had now won their revenge for past injuries. Thirty-six
Guelph houses were pulled down: among them the
Tosinghi palace in the New Market, a building measuring
one hundred and thirty-five feet in height, and faced with
many tiers of marble columns. Party hatred reached
such a pitch as to justify the belief expressed by many
that the Ghibellines had positively decreed the destruction
of San Giovanni, because the Guelphs had used that
church as a place of assembly. It was affirmed that the
victors had undermined the foundations of the adjoining
Guardamorto tower, hoping that this might fall down on
the temple and crush it. The failure of the attempt was
attributed to the fact that the tower had miraculously
fallen in another direction. A more credible account is
given by Vasari. He says that the Guardamorto was only
demolished in order to widen the Piazza, and that Niccolò
Pisano, being charged with the work, cut the tower in two
and arranged its fall in a way to avoid any damage to the
church or neighbouring houses.</p>

<p>At all events, this proved the beginning of the long
list of savage reprisals darkening the history of Florence,
when the winning faction not only destroyed the dwellings
of the defeated, but banished their foes <i><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</span></i>. The
Ghibellines were now masters of all, and for their greater
security retained the services of Count Giordano Lancia
and his eight hundred Germans. It seemed as though
the party, being of Teutonic origin, could not yet grasp
the reins of government without the support of German
soldiery, and could only command the Republic in the
emperor's name. This was the final result of admitting
the Imperial feudal nobility within the walls of Florence,
and allowing them to institute a political and military
chief instead of an ordinary judge in the person of the
Podestà.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The Ghibelline victory over the Guelphs of Florence in
1249, with all its violence and bloodshed, was by no means
an assured triumph. The Ghibellines had destroyed free
institutions and exiled a vast number of adversaries;
aided by the Imperial vicar, Giordano Lancia and his
eight hundred men, they were absolute masters of
Florence; nevertheless, the populace, the burghers, and
the greater part of the citizens still remained Guelphs.
Besides, Pope Innocent IV. roused so many enemies
against the emperor in Italy, that the latter's success was
destined to a speedy decline. The Florentine exiles were
biding their time in neighbouring strongholds, and above
all in the Castles of Montevarchi and Capraia in the upper
and lower Val d'Arno. From these points they made
frequent skirmishing expeditions, clearly showing that
they had by no means lost hope of soon re-entering the
city. Accordingly, the conquerors had to be perpetually
on the alert against them to provide against some sudden
attack restoring them to power.</p>

<p>Therefore Ghibellines and Germans marched against
Montevarchi; but almost the whole storming force was
killed or captured. This defeat opened the eyes of the
Florentine Ghibellines to the danger of their position, and
decided them to lay regular siege to the Castle of Capraia,
headquarters of the principal Guelphs, chiefs of the party
or League, as it was called at the time, directing all the
movements of the rest. Although the beleaguering force
greatly outnumbered their own, the besieged decided on
an obstinate defence, and the Ghibellines were bent on
winning the castle either by violence or starvation. But
they would have failed to accomplish this but for the
arrival of reinforcements from the emperor, who, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
been compelled to raise the siege of Parma, had now
advanced into Tuscany. But, in spite of these fresh foes,
hunger alone drove the Guelphs to surrender. Their
leaders were given up to Frederic II., who was then at
Fucecchio. He carried them with him to the kingdom
of Naples, and, according to the Florentine chroniclers,
had them barbarously blinded, beaten to death with clubs,
or drowned in the sea, with the exception of one alone,
whose life was spared after his eyes had been torn out.</p>

<p>By this time the emperor was irritated and exhausted
by the continual wars thrust on him by the Papacy. He
had enjoyed no peace since the day (June 24, 1243) when
Sinibaldo de Fieschi ascended the Chair of St. Peter as
Pope Innocent IV. This pontiff had pronounced his
deposition at the Council of Lyons in 1245. He had
then secretly excited many conspiracies against him, and
attempted more or less to ensure their success. The
emperor had been led to suspect his most devoted friend
and secretary, Pier delle Vigne, of complicity in one of
these plots. Accordingly this faithful servant was thrown
into the tower of San Miniato al Tedesco, condemned to
lose his eyes, and then transferred to another prison in
Pisa, where he dashed out his brains against the wall.
Frederic's spirit was alternately cowed and irritated by
the hostility he encountered; for, with all his philosophy
and unbelief, he greatly dreaded the thunders of the
Vatican. He sought reconciliation with the Pope, wished
to return to the East to fight the infidels; and Innocent
chose that moment to rouse all the Guelph cities against
him, thus again forcing him to fly to arms to support the
Ghibelline cause and maintain his own sway over Italy.</p>

<p>This he was unable to effect without recurring, as
we have seen, to incredible excesses of violence, which
naturally increased the number of his enemies on all
sides. The Guelphs of Germany had already refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
acknowledge the authority of his son Corrado, whom
he had sent as his representative. The army commanded
by the emperor in person had been routed at Parma. All
the Guelph cities of Romagna, with Bölogna at their head,
marched a powerful force against the Ghibellines under
King Enzo, another of Frederic's natural sons, and
defeated them at the battle of Fossalta on May 26,
1249. Enzo himself was captured and carried in
triumph to Bologna, where he remained a prisoner till
his death in 1271. But the emperor did not live long
enough to feel this last blow. On December 13,
1250, he ceased to breathe in a castle near Lucera in
Apulia, and his death completed the downfall of the
Ghibelline party in Florence and throughout Italy.
For religious hatred was now combined with political
enmity against this party. Not only because the
Ghibellines combated the Pope, but still more, because
the various heresies gradually spreading through Italy
found many followers in their ranks, in consequence
of frequent marks of tolerance and favour received from
the emperor. The heretical poison now slowly infecting
the Italian social body was a grave anxiety to the Popes.
The Albigenses had first roused attention and found
adherents in Provence, where native bards had devoted
their talents to attacking the Roman Court. But the
religious orders of St. Francis and St. Dominic were
bent on crushing the new creed. Innocent III. had
founded the Holy Inquisition for the same purpose,
and St. Dominic, at the head of mobs thirsting for
heretic blood, had ordained the massacre of the Albigenses
and ravaged all Provence. Some fugitives, however,
had escaped into Italy, to spread the same hatred
against Rome, the same poison of heresy. In fact, the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Paterini</span></i>, opposed to the Pope, denying the virginity of
the Madonna, and having no belief in transubstantiation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
or other dogmas of the Catholic faith, found followers
everywhere and held public gatherings. The Epicurean,
Averrhoistic, and other philosophical tenets were rapidly
propagated among Italian scholars. For some time,
during the most brilliant period of the Imperial Court
in Sicily, all this intellectual and religious turmoil seemed
to be chiefly centred at Palermo. For there Frederic II.
had gathered about him a throng of scholars, troubadours,
poets of every kind, Mussulmans, Greek schismatics,
Provençal Albigenses, and materialistic philosophers; and
although a crusader and persecutor of heretics, took
singular delight in this mixed society, in whose midst,
and in a storm of sarcasm, doubt, and hatred of priests,
Italian poetry first sprang to life, and later on, in the
Divine Comedy, gave forth so great a wealth of earnest
faith and lofty aspiration. In the meantime, however,
heresy and scepticism were current throughout the
Peninsula. The <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Paterini</span></i> quickly obtained many converts
among the Ghibellines in Florence, and the Pope
established the Inquisition there for the trial and punishment
of backsliders. In 1244 Fra Pietro of Verona,
moved by religious fury rather than zeal, came to stir
the orthodox spirit by his inflammatory sermons; and
founded the Society of the Captains of Holy Mary or
of Faith, composed of men and women vowed to the
extermination of heretics. Public feeling caught fire in
1245, and a real battle between Catholics and heretics
raged in the Florence streets. Both at Santa Felicità
and in the space by the Croce al Trebbio, where a
column still commemorates the ill-fated event, the <i>Captains
of the Faith</i>, robed in white, bearing the badge
of the cross, and commanded by their big, strong, dare-devil
chief, Friar Pietro of Verona, routed the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Paterini</span></i>
and drove them from Florence. In reward for this
sanguinary triumph the friar was appointed Inquisitor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Tuscany, and subsequently of Lombardy as well. There
in the north, between Milan and Como, he finally met
his death at the hands of men wearied of his persecutions.
This gained him the title of a martyred saint, and he was
known henceforth as St. Peter&mdash;Martyr of <span class="locked">Verona.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, in 1250, the year now claiming our attention,
Frederic II. passed away, his son Enzo lay captive
in Bölogna, Innocent IV. was stirring the Guelphs to
action, and Pietro of Verona had become the scourge
of all heretics and foes of the Papacy in Tuscany and
Lombardy. Accordingly the Ghibelline domination in
Florence was approaching its end. In fact, from the
moment that the emperor withdrew into Apulia, already
stricken with mortal disease, the Guelphs showed so much
boldness that the Ghibellines decided on a fresh expedition
to oust them from the Castle of Ostina, in the
Valdarno, where they had assembled in great force. But
while laying siege to the stronghold the Ghibellines were
compelled to keep a strong reserve at Figline to protect
their rear from the many Guelph partisans lurking at
Montevarchi. The latter, however, made a night attack on
the force encamped at Figline, and routed it so thoroughly
that when the news reached Ostina the Ghibellines raised
the siege and marched back to the capital. Thereupon
both the people and burghers of Florence, tired of the
unbearable load of taxation imposed on them by the
continual wars undertaken by the Ghibellines, and worn
out by the "grave extortions and acts of violence of these
tyrannical masters," felt that the moment for vengeance had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
come, and rose in open revolt. The rebels were led by
the more influential citizens of the so-called middle class,
then acting as heads of the people. These men first held
their sittings in the Church of San Firenze, then in Santa
Croce, and finally, still dreading attack from the Uberti,
assembled in smaller numbers and with greater safety in
the houses of the Anchioni family. Here, in October,
1250, they proclaimed the nomination of thirty-six
"Corporals of the people," six to each <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestiere</span></i>, forming
the basis of the third Florentine Constitution, known as
the First Popular Government (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Primo Popolo</span></i>), because
its main purpose was to organise and strengthen the people
in opposition to the nobles, and by this time the latter
being much disheartened, unresistingly submitted to the
new government. The first measure adopted was the
dismissal of all the magistrates in office, and reforms were
then undertaken. The post of Podestà was retained,
and henceforth this official became still more exclusively
the head of the patricians, being now counterbalanced by
the newly instituted Captain of the people, as chief of
the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i>. But, as in this way the Republic was
divided in two parts, a central, presiding body was established
consisting of twelve elders (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">anziani</span></i>) of the people,
two for each <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestiere</span></i>. These <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">anziani</span></i> had some of the
attributes of the Consuls of former days, with this
difference, however, that not only were they men of the
people, but that the chief government of the city was
now entrusted to the Podestà and the Captain. In fact,
the new and most important part of the reform was this
institution of a Captain as commander of the people, who
were now organised on a military footing. The city
was divided into twenty armed companies, with twenty
gonfalons or banners, under as many gonfalonieri. The
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, on the contrary, was organised in ninety-six
companies, corresponding with its ninety-six existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
parishes (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">pivieri</span></i>). These town and country companies
combined formed a united popular militia, ready for
action at any moment, either against foreign foes or to
curb patrician tyranny at home. The whole of this armed
multitude was under the orders of the Captain, and as
he combined the functions of tribune, general, and judge,
he afterwards bore the additional titles of <i>Defender of the
Guilds and the People, Captain of all the Guelphs</i>, &amp;c.
Similarly to the Podestà, the Captain held office for one
year, and it was indispensable that he should be a Guelph,
a noble, and an alien. He came to Florence provided
with his own judges, knights, and war-horses, inasmuch as
he was leader of the people in war and administrator of
justice in times of peace. But, as we have already stated,
the Podestà still retained his civil and military importance.
In right of his office, he had to give judgment in all civil
and criminal cases, those reserved for the Captain's decision
being usually acts of violence committed by the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>
against the people, questions regarding taxes or valuations,
and certain cases of extortion, perjury, and violence, provided
these had not been already cited before the Podestà,
or unless he should have refused them his <span class="locked">attention.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></span>
Also, in the above-mentioned cases, the Captain was likewise
empowered to adjudge capital punishment. The red
and white gonfalon or banner of the people was in his
charge, and by ringing the bell of the so-called Lion's
Tower he summoned the people to assembly. He resided
in the Badia, together with the elders, who acted as his
counsellors in many respects. Messer Uberto of Lucca
was the first Captain of the people. As to the Podestà,
although certain writers, misled by the somewhat obscure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
statements of Villani and Malespini, believed his office to
have been at least temporarily abolished, it is certain that
he remained at the head of what was specially called the
<span class="locked">Commune.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></span> He, too, had his companies of armed men,
and likewise commanded the mounted bands composed
almost exclusively of nobles, the bowmen and crossbowmen,
bucklermen (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">palvesari</span></i>), &amp;c., forming conjointly
the so-called host, or nucleus of regulars in the
mass of the Republican army. The Podestà was often
commander-in-chief of the whole army, but his special
function was the command of the cavalry and the host
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">oste</span></i>).<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> And for the further enhancement of his dignity,
it was decided to build a great and monumental <span class="locked">palace,<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></span>
in which he was to hold residence with his attendant
officers and counsellors. But, on the other hand, as
nothing was neglected to increase the strength of the
people against the patricians, it was decreed that the
towers of all powerful houses should be cut down so that
none should exceed the height of seventy-five feet (fifty
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">braccia</span></i>), and the superfluous material was used to wall in
the city on the south side of the river (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">oltr' Arno</span></i>).<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<p>This third constitution of Florence, known as the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Primo Popolo</span></i>, or First Popular Government, was in fact a
politico-military constitution, dividing the Republic into
two halves, the Commune and the people, and in which
the aristocrats and democrats formed, as it were, two
opposing camps. The army was marshalled under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
banners both of the Commune and the people; all important
measures required the sanction both of the Commune
and the people. A similar division of authority
may seem strange at this day, but it was common enough
in the Middle Ages. It was customary to many Tuscan
cities, and we find an example of it at Bölogna, where
the nobility and people formed, as it were, two distinct
republics, having different laws and statutes, and two
separate palaces for their respective magistrates. At
Milan we find a tripartite republic in the Credenza dei
Consoli, the Motta, and the Credenza di Sant Ambrogio,
consisting respectively of the greater and middle nobility
and the people. This seemed a perfectly natural arrangement,
seeing that social conditions are reflected in the
institutions to which they give birth; the social body was
divided, because it owed its origin to the struggle between
the Latin and Teutonic races, between conquerors and
conquered. Accordingly, the remote heirs of either race
stood arrayed in two opposite camps, armed and prepared
for <span class="locked">conflict.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></span></p>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 192.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>In this state of things it is easy to understand why the
central government had so little authority in Florence,
and why, during the continual clash of opposing interests
and jealousies, the power of the Podestà and the Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
should have steadily increased. The former, although his
functions were now shared by other magistrates, still
remained the chief official representative of the Republic;
for he signed treaties of peace, accepted concessions of
territory in that capacity, received oaths of submission to
Florence from other towns, and, as in times past, still continued
to preside over two councils&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Special and
the General, respectively composed of ninety and of three
hundred members. The Captain had likewise two councils,
the which, according to the usage of the time, consisted
of a Special Council, or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">credenza</span></i>, of eighty members,
making, in junction with the Council-General, a total of
three hundred. This body included the elders, the heads
of guilds, the gonfaloniers of companies, and others, and,
unlike the councils of the Podestà, to which nobles were
admitted, solely consisted of plebeians. Members of the
Special Council frequently sat in the General Assembly,
which was therefore usually styled the General and Special
Council of the Podestà, or the Captain, as the case might
be. The elders had a privy council of their own, composed
of thirty-six plebeian worthies; and the parliament
must not be forgotten, although at the time of which we
are treating it was only summoned on occasions of exceptional
importance. But, as will be shown, some time
elapsed before these councils were established on a definite
basis; none for the moment, save those of the Podestà,
which were of older origin, having any settled <span class="locked">formation.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></span>
At any rate, the Republic, as regarded its general outline,
was ordered in the following manner: the elders, the
council of thirty-six, and the parliament, formed a central
government, already much weakened, however, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
constitution and growing strength of the Commune and
people, inasmuch as these latter, commanded by the
Podestà and Captain, and with their respective greater and
lesser councils, formed, as it were, two opposing republics.
The Commune undoubtedly enjoyed superior authority
and legal importance; but the popular party became daily
bolder and more numerous. Before long, in fact, ancient
families began to change their names and drop their titles,
in order to join the ranks of the people.</p>

<p>The great political writers of Florence differed in opinion
with regard to the new constitution. Donato Giannotti
censured it, declaring it to be "a cause of sedition,
instead of a bond of peace and concord, because the
founders of that government directed it entirely against
the nobles, its former rulers in the days of Frederic, and
who now being in constant fear of attack, were obliged
to fly to arms on every <span class="locked">occasion."<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span> Machiavelli, on the
contrary, praised the Constitution, and wound up by
saying: "With these military and civil institutions the
foundations of Florentine freedom were laid. Nor is
it possible to imagine how much authority and strength
Florence thereby gained in a short space. For she not
only became the head of Tuscany, but was counted among
the foremost of Italian cities, and might have risen to any
height had she not been afflicted by new and frequent
<span class="locked">divisions."<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></span> Machiavelli judged rightly. Both contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
chroniclers of these events and the impartial voice
of history fully confirm the truth of his words.</p>

<p>The city now began to be enriched by new public
monuments. The Communal palace, otherwise known as
the palace of the Podestà, rose from the ground, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Santa Trinità bridge was built, chiefly at the expense of a
private citizen. The gold florin was now issued, and,
being mixed with the best alloy, speedily obtained
<span class="locked">currency<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></span> not only in all European markets, but even in
the Levant, greatly to the advantage of Florentine commerce,
which was daily becoming more widely extended.
The nobles were discontented, of course, and hastened to
show their ill-feeling, in 1251, by their almost unanimous
refusal to join in the war against Pistoia. But when a
few of them were sent into banishment the others soon
quieted down. The Guelph exiles were recalled, adversaries
within the city made peace, and now, that Frederic II.
was dead, the aristocracy was kept in check by the
strength and self-confidence of the popular party. Shortly
afterwards external wars began, and these were carried on
with so much success that the following ten years were
known as the years of victory.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>This First, or Old Popular Government, as it was called,
because it was in fact the first time that the people had a
political and military organisation of their own, quickly
asserted its strength. In order to give the spreading
Florentine trade free access to the sea, without yet coming
to blows with Pisa, the city concluded an agreement on
April 30, 1251, with the Counts Aldobrandeschi, powerful
lords of the Maremma, by which Florence was granted
right of passage through their territories to Porto Talamone
and Port' Ercole and the free use of these harbours for its
<span class="locked">merchandise.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></span> Thereupon the Pisans, being naturally
annoyed by this measure, hastened to contract an alliance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
with Sienna, to which Pistoia also adhered. Thus the
three Ghibelline cities were banded together against the
Florentine Guelphs. Nor was this the worst. On July 24,
1251, the Ghibellines of Florence joined the League by a
secret agreement with Sienna, binding either side to cooperate
towards their common aim&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the triumph of
their party throughout Tuscany. And as the other
Ghibellines of the country-side naturally adhered to the
treaty, the whole faction was united to the hurt of the
Republic.</p>

<p>Then the Florentines, finding themselves surrounded
by so many foes, began their defence by a rapid march
on Pistoia, but the Ghibellines of the city refused to take
part in a war openly directed against their cause. Accordingly,
when the army returned from a successful skirmishing
expedition, many leading Ghibellines, including the
Uberti and the Lamberti, were driven into banishment.
The affair must have been really serious, for the exiles
hoisted the banner of the Republic, whereupon the State
banner was changed, and instead of bearing the white lily
on a red field, henceforth displayed the red lily on a white
field; but the flag of the people remained as before, half
white and half red. During the summer of this year the
Ubaldini, reinforced by a body of exiles, rose to arms in
the Mugello, but suffered defeat. The Florentines at last
realised the danger of their position. Therefore, with the
help of their former friends the Lucchese, they concluded
an alliance (August, 1251) with the town of San Miniato
al Tedesco&mdash;where there was no Imperial vicar for the
moment&mdash;renewed in September their former treaty with
Orvieto, and in November made alliance with Genoa,
which was still hostile to Pisa.</p>

<p>Thus the whole of Tuscany was divided between the
Guelph and Ghibelline factions. The exiles, together with
some German soldiers who had served under Frederic II.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
occupied the Castle of Montaia, belonging to Count Guido
Novello, in the upper Val d'Arno. The Florentines
marched to the assault of the stronghold towards the end
of the year, but were ignominiously repulsed. On their
return to the city, they rang the alarm-bell, collected a
large force, again took the field, people and Commune
combined, and pursued the war with energy during the
month of January, regardless of frost and snow. The
general condition of affairs in Tuscany enlarged the proportions
of this war; for on the one side Lucchese troops
co-operated with the Florentine army, while the exiles on
the other received reinforcements from Pisa and Sienna.
The First Popular Government now proved its mettle.
The adversaries were driven off, the Castle of Mentaia captured
and demolished, and its defenders were led captives
to Florence in January, <span class="locked">1252.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></span></p>

<p>The Florentines then marched into the Pistoian territory,
laid it waste, and halted to attack the Castle of
Tizzano on their return. But while thus engaged they
heard that the Pisans, having routed the Lucchese, were
moving homewards with prisoners and spoil. Accordingly,
they raised the siege, hastened in pursuit, and giving
battle to the Pisans at Pontedera on July 1, 1252, completely
defeated them. Even the Podestà of Pisa was
captured, and another curious incident took place. The
Lucchese prisoners who were being dragged to Pisa in
bonds not only regained their liberty, but were enabled, by
the help of the Florentines, to convey to Lucca as captives
the same Pisans by whom they had been previously seized.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, profiting by the absence of the Florentine
troops, the exiles and Count Guido Novello had taken
refuge at Figline and made it the centre of continual
skirmishing expeditions. Hence it was indispensable to
unearth them all without delay. The town surrendered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
but only on condition that the strangers defending its wall
should be allowed to go free, and the exiles readmitted.
This was granted but then, in violation of the stipulated
terms, Figline itself was sacked and burnt (August,
1852).<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<p>But, the Siennese having simultaneously profited by the
opportunity to lay siege to Montalcino, a border fortress
always claimed by the Florentines, the latter hastened to
its relief, and after routing its assailants and providing
everything for the future defence of the stronghold,
marched back to Florence in triumph.</p>

<p>These successes were not unproductive of results. For
when the Florentines next attacked Pistoia in 1253, the
town surrendered after a brief resistance, and agreed
(February 1, 1254) to forsake the Ghibelline League, to
grant readmittance to the Guelphs, and to be entirely at
the service of <span class="locked">Florence.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></span> Thereupon the Florentines
hastened to defend Montalcino against another attack by
the Siennese; and thus the war with the latter, begun at the
end of 1253, was vigorously pursued in 1254, to the
month of June. Then, having lost many strongholds&mdash;some
captured by Florentine arms, others gained by purchase
from the Counts Guidi&mdash;Sienna was forced to end
the war and tender submission. On their way back to
Florence the victors reduced Poggibonsi, a large and important
territory adhering to Sienna and the Ghibellines.
They next proceeded to devastate the lands about Volterra,
although the city itself seemed impregnable from the
strength of its position. But when the Volterrani, counting
upon this, ventured to sally forth and give battle, they
were defeated and pursued with so much vigour, that the
Florentines found themselves inside the city before they
had even conceived the possibility of storming its walls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>There was such general alarm among the inhabitants that a
great throng of old men, women, and children, with the
bishop at their head, came as suppliants to make surrender.
The Florentines showed much generosity, prohibiting
pillage, and merely reforming the government of the city
by transferring it to the Guelphs. And now Pisa, being
bereft of all allies, finally agreed to surrender, and the
terms were subscribed on August 4, 1254. As a result of
this treaty the Florentines had right of passage through
Pisa, with their merchandise, and exemption from all taxes,
dues, or imposts, whether by sea or by land. Moreover,
in all contracts made with them, the Pisans were bound to
employ Florentine weights and measures, and also, to
some extent, Florentine money. They yielded several
districts and castles, that of Ripafratta included. And
they were compelled to give 150 hostages to secure
their observance of these conditions and of the friendship
to which they were sworn. Shortly after this event
Arezzo likewise made submission (25th of August), and
accepted a Podestà from <span class="locked">Florence.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></span></p>

<p>These were the "victorious years" of the First Popular
Government, whose merits and virtues received such
high praise from the chroniclers. Villani tells us, in words
afterwards repeated by his plagiarist, Malespini, that it
took "much pride in great and lofty undertakings," and
that its rulers "were very loyal and devoted to the
<span class="locked">Commune."<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></span> And he presently adds: "The citizens of
Florence lived soberly, on coarse viands and at little
expense; their manners were very good; they had courteous
ways; they were plain and frugal; and used rough stuff for
their own and their women's dress. And many wore
skins uncovered by cloth, and caps on their heads; all were
shod with leather; and the Florentine women wore plain
hose, and only the greater among them donned very narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
petticoats of coarse scarlet Ipro or Camo cloth, gathered in
at the waist by a leather belt in the old <span class="locked">style,<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></span> and a fur-lined
mantle with a hood attached to cover the <span class="locked">head;<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></span> and
common women wore gowns of coarse green Cambragio
stuff, made in the same fashion. And one hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>
was the usual dowry for a bride, two or three hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>
being considered in those times a splendid sum, and even
the most beautiful maidens were not given in marriage
until they were aged twenty years, or <span class="locked">more."<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></span> Even the
evidence of the "Divina Commedia" fully corroborates
this account of the goodness and honesty of the Florentines
of old, and events continued to prove the truth of the
verdict.</p>

<p>Fortune favoured the city not only in war, but also in
peace both within and without the walls. In addition to
the many great public works we have already mentioned,
and which were now completed, other buildings were in
course of erection on various sites bought by the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">anziani</span></i>
for the purpose in different parts of the city. These
officials, together with the captain of the people, Lambertino
di Guido Lambertini, likewise decreed (1252&ndash;53)
that the register of all the communal deeds should be
re-copied and carried on regularly, in order, as they said,
that the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">jura et rationes Communis</span></i> might not be left
unknown nor neglected, but open to the public in various
places. These papers are the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">capitoli</span></i> still preserved at
the present time, and affording so much useful information
on the history of <span class="locked">Florence.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></span></p>

<p>Now, however, the state of affairs was about to take a
fresh turn. In consequence of Conrad's decease, Manfred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the other son of Frederic II., succeeded to the Neapolitan
throne. The new sovereign, being dauntless, ambitious,
and full of talent, devoted all his powers to forwarding the
interests of the Italian Ghibellines; and the Florentines,
with their usual shrewdness, immediately became more
cautious in their proceedings. In 1255 they made alliance
with Sienna, the following year with Arezzo, severely
blamed their captain, Count Guido Guerra, for expelling
the Ghibellines from the latter city, and compelled him to
recall them. They even treated their own exiles with
greater indulgence and liberality, permitting some of them
to return from time to time. But on either side these
were false demonstrations, leading to no result. All were
temporising, waiting to see what fresh turn the general
affairs of Italy might take.</p>

<p>Supposing Manfred's fortunes to be really restored, the
Florentines would suffer severely, and of this they were
perfectly aware. A first warning was received by them in
1256, when the Pisans, oblivious of sworn terms and
promises, made an attack upon Ponte a Serchio, a castle
held by the Lucchese, the allies of Florence. Accordingly
the Florentines hastened to their friends' relief, and routed
the assailants, many of whom were drowned in the river
in their flight. After this victory the troops marched
towards Pisa and coined money in sight of the walls, an
act then considered to inflict deep humiliation on the
enemy. In addition to this the Pisans were not only
forced to renew (September 23, 1256) the ignominious
peace concluded in 1254, but also to cede many castles to
the Florentines, and some few to the <span class="locked">Lucchese.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></span> And
another clause was added to the terms stipulating that the
Castle of Mutrone, a position of great strategical importance
both to Lucchese and Florentines, should be given
up to the latter, with power to destroy or preserve it, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
their magistrates might decide. Accordingly the question
was discussed by a council of elders in Florence, and
one of the number, Aldobrandino Ottobuoni, who, although
poor and plebeian, had much influence as a patriot, asserted
the necessity of demolishing the fortress. His proposal
was carried, but with the proviso that it should be first
submitted to the approval of the parliament. Meanwhile
the Pisans, unaware of the result of the discussion and of
Ottobuoni's amendment, but knowing that the castle, if
held by the Lucchese, would be a serious menace to themselves,
sent to offer Ottobuoni four thousand florins&mdash;in
those days a prodigious sum&mdash;if he would address the
council in favour of the very plan he had already pleaded
with success. But this offer merely opened his eyes to the
blunder he had committed, and returning to the council,
he induced the elders to reverse their decision. Aldobrandino's
reputation was so greatly enhanced by this affair,
that on his death it was decreed that a monument should
be erected to him in the Duomo of greater height than
any other, and at the public <span class="locked">expense.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></span></p>

<p>Many men were famed for their virtue in the time of
the First Popular Government; but this government only
lasted ten years, and a period of new reforms and revolutions,
costing much travail to the Republic, is already near
at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The seeds of revolt were already lurking in the Constitution,
and, as we have seen, only waiting a convenient
opportunity to break forth. Nor was the moment long
delayed. The Ghibelline party, after declining in consequence
of Frederic's decease, was now revived in Italy by
the strenuous efforts of Manfred in its cause. This
monarch's envoys finally came to Florence in 1258, and
naturally made their abode with the Uberti, whom they
found quite prepared to try the hazard of war. These
nobles quickly assembled their adherents, and formed a
plot for the overthrow of the popular government. But
the times were not yet ripe, because, as Machiavelli has
justly remarked, "In those days the Guelphs had much
more power than the Ghibellines, partly because the people
hated the latter for their arrogant conduct as rulers in
Frederic's time; and partly because the side of the Church
was in greater favour than that of the emperor, seeing
that with the aid of the Church they [the Florentines]
hoped to preserve their liberty, and feared to lose it under
the <span class="locked">emperor."<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></span> The conspiracy was soon discovered, in
fact, and the Uberti were cited to appear before the elders.
But, instead of obeying the summons, they barricaded
themselves within their own dwellings by the advice of
their chief, Farinata. Thereupon the enraged people flew
to the assault; the houses of the Uberti were sacked;
some of their friends captured, others killed, and no mercy
shown even to those merely suspected of complicity. The
Abbot of Vallombrosa, one of the Beccaria of Pavia, was
beheaded, although his innocence was afterwards acknowledged
by <span class="locked">many.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></span> The whole Uberti family and their
principal followers had to seek safety in exile and fly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Sienna, the which city was the declared ally of Manfred,
and the headquarters of all Tuscan Ghibellines. The
exiles collected there chose Farinata, the most daring and
influential member of the band, for their leader. Upon
this the Florentines justly complained that the Siennese
violated the treaty of 1255 by harbouring the fugitives;
but Sienna, having been long the secret ally of the Ghibellines,
was deaf to remonstrance.</p>

<p>Hence collision was inevitable, and Florence dealt the
first blow by speedily attacking several castles and villages
in the Siennese <span class="locked">Maremma.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></span> Then the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Martinella</span></i> was
hung in the arch of the Mercato Nuovo, and repeatedly
rang the alarm, announcing an expedition of far greater
importance. Both sides began to prepare for war, and
even summoned their friends to assemble. Florence had
sent Brunetto Latini on an embassy to Alfonso of Castile,
one of the aspirants to the Imperial crown, inviting him
to march into Italy against Manfred. The Siennese, however,
had already, and with greater hopes of success,
applied for help, through the Florentine exiles, to Manfred
in person. This monarch being much occupied with his
own kingdom at the time, despatched Giordano d'Anglona,
Count of San Severino, with about one hundred German
knights, who reached Sienna in December, 1259, bearing
the royal banner. At last, in April, 1260, the Florentines
set forth with the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">carroccio</span></i>, people and Commune in full
array, with the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Podestà Iacopino Rangoni</span></i>, the elders and
leaders of companies at their head, and encamped close to the
walls of Sienna, near Porta Camollia. On the 17th of May
a battle took place on the site of the monastery of Santa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Petronilla. It is related that when Farinata degli Uberti,
who, as chief of the exiles, had done much to promote the
war, saw how small a contingent Manfred had sent with
the standard, he exclaimed: "We will lead it into such
straits, that he [the king] will fain be the enemy of the
Florentines, and will give us more [knights] than we
shall <span class="locked">want."<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></span> It is also told that the German soldiers
were purposely intoxicated to make them fight with blind
<span class="locked">fury.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></span> What is certain is that the Siennese citizens
marched out under the command of their Podestà, and
that the Germans, jointly with the exiles, of whom Farinata
was still the chief, were led by Count Guido Novello.
The Germans began the engagement with so furious an
onslaught that the Florentines, believing a formidable
army was on them, scattered in dismay; but then, perceiving
the hostile force to be inferior to their own, stood
their ground valiantly, and after a sanguinary mêlée
repulsed the foe, and capturing Manfred's flag, dragged
it in the mud. There was much rejoicing in Florence,
although the victory had been dearly bought, and it was
seen that a small band of well-trained German cavalry
had put to the rout, at least for a moment, a large army
of peasants and artisans. The Siennese derived courage
from the same fact, particularly now that their chief
citizen, Provenzano Salvani, and other ambassadors, were
returning from Naples with a stout contingent of eight
<span class="locked">hundred<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></span> Germans, also under the command of Count
Giordano, now promoted to the post of vicar-royal to
Manfred in Tuscany.</p>

<p>Accordingly the war had to be pursued; for with the
Siennese already in the field to subdue Staggia and Poggibonsi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
and devastate Colle, Montalcino, and Montepulciano,
the Florentines were compelled to resume
hostilities. Farinata degli Uberti and his fellow-exiles
continually cast fresh fuel on the flame by using every
device of ingenuity to provoke their foes, and weave
treasonable plots within the walls of Florence. In fact,
two friars were sent there to inform the elders, with great
affectation of secresy, that Sienna was weary of the Ghibellines
and of Provenzano Salvani's domination, that
accordingly it would be easy to have the gates opened
to the Florentine army by means of a bribe of ten
thousand florins. The friars, being deceived themselves,
as it appears, had no difficulty in duping others.
According to Villani's account, on arriving in the city,
they asked leave to confer with two elders alone, under
pledge of the strictest secresy. Two members were
deputed to receive their proposals, who, believing the men
to come from the exiles, sons of their own Republic, and
forgetting how they had always been dominated by party
hatred, accepted the false message in good faith. Although
great mystery was observed in the affair, yet it was necessary
to consult the citizens before deciding on war. For
that purpose a numerous council of nobles and <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i>
was assembled, and the elders, under more or less plausible
pretexts, urged the necessity of quickly resuming the war
against Sienna. Nevertheless, there was much disagreement.
Although the Florentine laws opposed every possible
check to general discussion, and especially when directed
against any proposal brought forward by a <span class="locked">magistrate,<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
the import of this question was seen to be so grave, that
several speakers combated it, pointing out the enormous
folly of plunging into war at this moment, when it was
known that Sienna had no means of maintaining the
Germans for long. The nobles were specially adverse
to the proposal, for they had recognised the superiority
of the German cavalry, and judged that no army composed
of artisans and traders, little practised in war, could
possibly make a stand against it, especially now that it
was in much greater force. Also, seeing what progress
had been already made in the art of war, battles could no
more be won by deeds of personal prowess alone. Unluckily
the opposition of the nobles inflamed the people
in the contrary sense, and set them shouting that they
must arm and march forth without delay. Tegghiaio
Aldobrandi degli Adimari was one of the first patricians
to speak against the proposal and in favour of delay.
But an elder named Spedito, and, according to Villani, one
of the two sharing the secret, replied to him in insulting
terms, winding up with a coarse sneer at Adimari's supposed
<span class="locked">cowardice.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></span> Whereupon Messer Tegghiaio retorted,
exclaiming that Spedito would lack the courage to follow
far at his heels in battle. After this squabble Cece
Gherardini rose up and openly inveighed against the war
proposed by the elders. The latter then insisted on his
silence, in the name of the law, threatening to make him
pay the fine of one hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i> imposed by the statutes
on all venturing to speak without the permission of the
magistrates; but Gherardini replied that he would pay it
and speak. Accordingly they increased the fine to two
hundred, then to three hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>, but only succeeded in
silencing him by threats of capital <span class="locked">punishment.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></span> So the
motion for war was finally carried, although even without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
the secret intrigues retailed and exaggerated by the
chroniclers, the heated state of public feeling made hostilities
unavoidable.</p>

<p>The Florentine army was still commanded in 1260 by
the same Podestà who had led it to battle the previous
May. But it was now reinforced by all the Guelphs of
Tuscany, from Perugia, Orvieto, Bölogna, and many
other cities, so that its total strength amounted to thirty
thousand foot and three thousand horse. This large force
marched forth in the month of August, with all its chiefs,
with the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i>, and a well-furnished baggage train,
crossed the Siennese border, and reaching Pieve Asciata
on September 2nd, halted there to rest. The intrigues
carried on by the exiles had produced two results; for
on the one hand they had inspired Florence with the
vain hope that Sienna could be gained without bloodshed,
merely by spending money and making a great show of
strength; on the other hand there were traitors in the
army itself, actually pledged to secret agreements with
the enemy. The first measure adopted was to send
messengers to the city haughtily demanding its surrender.
But when these envoys entered Sienna they found the whole
population burning for war and revenge. They were
solemnly received by the Council of Twenty-four, the
heads of the State; and these, on hearing their demands,
made reply: "<i>That they should have an answer, by word
of mouth, in the field</i>." Hence the only thing to do was
to prepare for a decisive engagement.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 3rd of September a herald
went through the streets of Sienna calling on all men to
hasten to join his own flag, "in the name of God and the
Virgin <span class="locked">Mary."<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></span> Thus a considerable army was collected
and marched the same day to encounter the Florentines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
The details supplied by the chroniclers are so discrepant
that it is difficult to decide as to the exact strength of the
force. The Germans, the exiled Ghibellines of Florence,
and several contingents from allies swelled the Siennese
ranks. Nevertheless the total number was certainly
inferior to that of the enemy. According to custom,
the Podestà, Francesco Troghisio, held the post of Commander-in-chief.
But the actual leaders of the army
were Count Giordano and Count D'Arras in command of
the German horse and foot; Count Aldobrandino of Santa
Fiora, and other valiant captains. The Florentine exiles,
including Farinata degli Uberti, who was excited to the
highest pitch, were under the command of Count Guido
Novello. The army of Florence was also led by its
Podestà, Jacopo Rangoni; but its captains were untrained
men, who still clung to the hope of winning the victory
without striking a blow. They advanced with the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i> as far as Monselvoli in Val di Biena, and
encamped at a short distance from the Arbia stream and
the fortress of Montaperti, some four miles from Sienna.
On the morning of the 4th of September the Siennese,
and more especially the Germans, began the battle by a
tremendous onslaught. The Count of Arras kept his
men in ambush in order to fall on the enemy's flank
at the best moment. Until the hour of vespers, the
Florentines made a steadfast resistance, but then began to
show signs of failing strength. Thereupon Arras led up
his reserve with cries of "St. George," and attacked them
so furiously in flank that they were speedily routed. At
the same moment Bocca degli Abati, one of the Florentine
traitors, severed at a blow the hand of Jacopo dei
Pazzi, the standard-bearer of the cavalry. As the flag
fell the troop, composed almost entirely of nobles,
instantly took to flight, some from panic, others with
treasonable intent. But the infantry, consisting of stout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i> and faithful allies, stood its ground for a time;
then wavered, gave way, and was involved in the general
rout. Only the guards of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i>, commanded by
Giovanni Tornaquinci, a veteran of seventy years, who
fought like a lion, maintained their position until the last
man fell dead defending the banner. Then, finally, the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i>, the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Martinella</span></i>, and the flag of the Republic
were captured by the foe, who bore their spoil to Sienna
in triumph and reduced it to <span class="locked">atoms.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></span> Great slaughter
took place, and although many Florentines sought safety
in the castle of Montaperti, crying, "Mercy, I surrender!"
no mercy was shown them. Finally the Siennese captain,
Count Giordano, by the advice of Farinata degli Uberti
and with the consent of the gonfaloniers of the people,
gave orders that the slaughter should be stopped, and
safety granted to all who <span class="locked">surrendered.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></span> It is difficult to
decide how many were killed on that fatal day. Villani,
keeping to the minimum, states that all the cavalry escaped
by flight, the slaughter being confined to the infantry,
of whom 2,500 were killed and 1,500 captured. The
Siennese, reducing their own losses to 600 killed and 400
wounded, estimate those of the Florentines at 10,000
killed, 15,000 taken prisoner, 5,000 wounded, and 18,000
horses either killed or strayed. These figures may be
exaggerated, but Villani's are certainly below the real
<span class="locked">number.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></span> Nevertheless, the chronicler shows the true
state of things when he says in conclusion, "and then
the ancient Florentine people was put to rout and <span class="locked">annihilated."<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></span>
This, in fact, was the ultimate result of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
battle "<i>that stained the Arbia red</i>" ("<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">che fece l'Arbia
colorata in rosso</span></i>").</p>

<p>Sienna triumphed with great rejoicing, great festivities;
but there was a terrible outcry and lamentation in
Florence, where no family had escaped loss. The leading
Guelphs knew that their last chance of safety had vanished,
and therefore many of their noble families fled into exile
together with a considerable number of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i>. They
escaped from the city on the 13th of September, and
although a few of them were scattered among the Tuscan
castles, the majority repaired to Lucca, this being still the
chief centre of the Guelph faction.</p>

<p>On the 16th of September Count Giordano entered
Florence with his German troops, accompanied by the
Ghibelline exiles laden with spoil and ready to play the
conquerors. One of their first deeds was the destruction
of the Ottobuoni monument in the Duomo, forgetful that
whether Guelph or Ghibelline that virtuous citizen deserved
honour as a patriot. Thus, from the beginning, the
Ghibellines did their best to make themselves more detested
and unbearable. Poggibonsi, Montalcino, and
many of the castles which had cost so much strife, were
given up to Sienna. The "ordinances of liberty" were
annulled, and Count Giordano nominated Count Guido
Novello Podestà of Florence for two <span class="locked">years.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></span> The latter
immediately took possession of the Communal palace, and
opened a road thence to the city walls, with the name it
still bears of Via Ghibellina. Meanwhile sentences of
banishment and persecution of all sorts befel the Guelphs.
Their houses and towers were demolished, and their
confiscated property devoted to the service of the Ghibelline
cause, which was everywhere destined to triumph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Brunetto Latini was also condemned to exile. As we
have seen, he had been an ambassador to Alphonso of
Castile, and was now in France, where he wrote the
"Tesoro" containing an account of his mission.</p>

<p>Count Giordano, being recalled to Naples by Manfred,
soon took his departure, leaving Guido Novello to replace
him. Thereupon all the Ghibelline chiefs met in council
at Empoli to arrange what was to be done. As an instance
of the pitch of ferocity to which party hatred against
Florence had attained, it was proposed at this meeting to
demolish the city walls, pull down all the houses, and
reduce this "nest of Guelphs" to a mere suburb, since
otherwise they would be sure to revive there once more.
But Farinata degli Uberti had the generosity to oppose
the suggestion, and in the impulse of his wrath clapped
his hand on his sword-hilt, and declared to Count Giordano
and the other captains that he had fought to regain his
country, not to lose it, and would defend it against all
would-be destroyers even more zealously than he had
fought against the <span class="locked">Guelphs.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></span> These words caused the
wild proposal to be instantly rejected.</p>

<p>Count Guido appointed several Ghibelline Podestà in
Tuscany, while retaining the general government of that
province in his own grasp, and likewise ruling Florence as
vicar to King Manfred. He basely allowed himself to
be the tool of Ghibelline vengeance, although his uncertainty
of conduct and weakness of character did little
service to the party. Nevertheless, the Guelphs continued
to suffer persecution, not only in Florence, where confiscation
of their property and destruction of their dwellings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
and towers were long the order of the <span class="locked">day,<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></span> but also in
the neighbouring castles and at Lucca, whence all fugitive
Guelphs were expelled. It was on this occasion that Farinata
degli Uberti, having seized Cece dei Buondelmonti,
hoisted him on his saddle and carried him off, either to
save his life, as some have said, or, according to another
version, as prisoner of war. But his brother Pietro degli
Uberti was so maddened at the sight, that he clubbed the
captive to death on Farinata's horse. Such was the ferocity
of party hatred at the time. After the defeat of 1260
many Guelphs wandered homeless about the world. Some
devoted their swords to the service of their faction in
Emilia, and became experts in the newest developments
of military science; while others settled in France as
traders, thus giving a fresh and much increased impulse
to Florentine commerce.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>From the close of 1260, the year of the battle of
Montaperti, down to 1266, when the rule of Count Guido
and King Manfred came to an end, the history of Florence
records no remarkable event. The city's freedom is
crushed, its wars reduced to petty and inglorious party
strife, and its new institutions, if worthy to be so called,
have no effect on the historical development of the Florentine
constitution. In trying to discover the logical connection
between the various forms assumed by it in the
history of the Republic, no attention need be given to the
checks suffered by freedom nor to the intervals wherein
tyranny breaks the regular course of events and institutions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
seeing that these resume their normal march as soon
as liberty is restored to life.</p>

<p>The Podestà ruling in Manfred's name retained the
two councils, <i>i.e.</i>, the general council of three hundred,
and the special of ninety members, in both of which
the nobles and the Ghibellines naturally prevailed. But
we hear nothing more of the Captain of the people and
his councils, nor of the elders and their assembly. But we
find in their place a body of twenty-four citizens, four to
each <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestiere</span></i>, privileged to sit in council with the Podestà.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a>
Of the ancient Constitution a few fragments alone remain,
and even these are ancient only in name. As
a matter of fact the Ghibellines had succeeded, with
Manfred's assistance, in establishing an aristocratic
despotism, as strangely different from the constitution
preceding it as from that destined to replace it, these
being in perfect harmony and connection one with the
other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the war against the Guelphs was carried on,
not only by razing their houses and confiscating their
goods, but by the imposition of repeated fines weighing
heavily on the lower classes who were now deprived of
all share in the government. But in 1264 Farinata degli
Uberti died, in 1265 Dante Alighieri was born, and Italy
began to be stirred by novel events soon to be echoed
even in Florence.</p>

<p>For some time past, in truth, Italian politics had showed
signs of approaching to a radical change. Frederic II.,
although often cruelly despotic, had gathered about him,
nevertheless, all the most cultured men of the country
and was highly popular among them. His successor,
Manfred, was an adventurous and unfortunate prince,
whose loftiness of spirit deservedly gained him numerous
admirers. It is true that the Papacy had combated both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
in their quality of Ghibellines; but the policy of Rome
was gradually becoming no less hostile to communal
freedom than to the Ghibelline cause, inasmuch as the
Papal ambition daily increased and sought to strengthen
the temporal power at the expense of the communes.
Florence still remained Guelph; but with changed times
the character and value, if not the names of parties were
beginning to suffer alteration throughout Italy. Hence
men often changed sides with small hesitation, nor was
it always easy to say whether those who deserted their
own party had changed, or whether the alteration of the
party itself had caused it to be forsaken. Also the
general confusion was greatly increased now that the
Popes, with their usual anxiety and dread of losing their
supremacy in Italy, resolved on calling fresh strangers
to their aid and thus drew fresh miseries on the land.</p>

<p>Alarmed by the great power and reputation gained by
the Swabian line, they sought defence in the course of
policy so well described by Machiavelli when he remarks
that the Popes, "sometimes for the love of religion, at
others to forward their own ambitions, never ceased to
call fresh humours into Italy and stir fresh wars. And
no sooner had they raised a prince to power than they
repented and sought to compass his ruin, nor would they
consent that any province their own weakness prevented
them from seizing should be possessed by <span class="locked">another."<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span>
Thus, after many persistent intrigues, they finally decided
the Angevins to undertake an expedition against Manfred,
and for the conquest of the Neapolitan kingdom.</p>

<p>With the aid and benediction of Pope Clement IV.,
Charles of Anjou brought an army composed not only
of his own subjects, but of many Italians, among whom
the exiled Florentine Guelphs were some of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
distinguished for <span class="locked">bravery.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></span> He advanced to the Neapolitan
frontier, and near Benevento, on February 26,
1266, gave battle to the foe. King Manfred fought
valiantly, and when forsaken and betrayed by his soldiery,
died the death of a hero on the field. For three days,
vain search was made for his corpse among the slain,
then it was found, and carried off on the back of an
ass. The French monarch refused Manfred burial in
consecrated ground, because the Pope had declared him
excommunicate. Accordingly he was laid in a ditch by
the bridge of Benevento, where the French soldiers,
casting each a stone on the corpse, raised a pile that
proved a fitting monument to the courage and ill
fortune of a warrior slain sword in hand. But Pope
Clement grudged him even this humble grave, and at
his command the Archbishop of Cosenza persuaded the
Angevin monarch to have the corpse exhumed, and
thrown beyond the frontier of the Neapolitan kingdom,
on the banks of the river <span class="locked">Verde.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></span> All these events
completed the overthrow of the Ghibelline party in
Italy. The Imperial throne stood vacant, the Suabians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
were crushed, and another foreign dynasty succeeded them
in Naples, summoned thither by the Pope. If Frederic's
decease had caused the decline of the Ghibellines in
Florence, it is easy to imagine what was to befal them
now that their evil sway had accumulated such increased
detestation of their rule, and that the death of Manfred
not only deprived them of a friendly sovereign, but
extinguished in Italy the domination of an Imperial and
royal line that had been their strongest support.</p>

<p>In fact, when the result of the campaign was announced
in Florence, the whole population was moved and stirred
to fresh courage against the nobles still holding rule
over them. And when it was known that the majority
of the Florentine Guelphs, who had done such brave
service in the ranks of King Charles, were returning to
Florence under his flag, the populace seemed so ready
to revolt that Count Guido and his followers were
stricken with fear. Therefore, as Machiavelli says,
"the Ghibellines judged it well to conciliate by some
acts of beneficence the people they had hitherto overwhelmed
with injuries; but although these remedies
would have succeeded had they been applied before the
emergency arose, now, on the contrary, being used too
late, not only failed of effect, but hastened the party's
<span class="locked">ruin."<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></span> In fact, when Count Guido and the Ghibelline
leaders sought to pacify the people by certain liberal
concessions they knew not where to begin. The old
laws had been annulled, and these men had so completely
alienated the people by their arbitrary government and
exactions, that no concession could now be made without
yielding on all points. On the other hand, the people,
being excluded from all share in the management of the
State, had turned to trade and commerce, employing
therein all the power and energy they were forbidden to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
bring to bear upon politics. Accordingly all branches
of trade were marvellously developed and organised
more firmly than before in the shape of politico-industrial
associations, entitled Greater and Lesser Guilds
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Arti maggiori ed Arti minori</span></i>), the which, dating from
the earliest years of the Middle Ages, had gradually
become significant political forces, and exercised very
great civic influence. Thus many new powerful families
had arisen, constituting a new aristocracy, as it were, of
wealthy traders, or, according to the designation already
bestowed on them, of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani grassi</span></i> (stout burghers)
now the virtual masters of the Florentine <span class="locked">citizens.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></span>
Gradually, therefore, the Ghibellines in power were
reduced to an isolated caste, and only enabled to maintain
their position by Manfred's friendly support and the
help of his German contingent. Being accordingly in the
attitude of invaders encamped on alien soil, their moral
and political ascendency, their civil authority daily
declined; while the burghers under their rule had won by
means of trade and commerce a separate world for themselves
and constituted a separate body, independent to
some extent of the governing authorities. It was both
difficult and dangerous to seek the help of the leading
burghers, for these, being chiefs of the Guelph population,
would undoubtedly insist on giving the latter a share
in the government, the which would lead to the speedy
downfall of the nobles and Ghibellines. Neither was it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
easy for the nobles to initiate partial reforms, since they
neither knew what concessions to make, nor how to
grant any at a moment when the people were conscious
of sufficient strength to dominate the city. It was
accordingly decided to summon from Bologna two knights
of a new order known as the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Frati Gaudenti</span></i>, whose
mission it was to succour widows and orphans and
reconcile hostile parties. Also, as a visible sign of
impartiality, one of the chosen knights was to be a
Guelph, the other a Ghibelline. All this was arranged
with the consent and almost at the instance of Pope
Clement IV., who, being of Provençal birth and a
strenuous supporter of Charles of Anjou, continually
addressed imperious missives to the <span class="locked">Florentines,<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></span> as
though the Imperial throne being vacant, its authority
had devolved upon himself, and the victory gained by
King Charles had made him master of Florence.</p>

<p>But, according to Villani's account, the short-lived
order of Frati Gaudenti consisted of men chiefly devoted
to their own pleasures, and little fitted for the serious
task of acting as Podestà of Florence, and promoting
novel reforms there. This was so evident that the two
knights speedily saw the necessity of consulting and
coming to an understanding with the guilds. Therefore,
on reaching the city, they made their abode in the palace
of the Commune, and convoked a council of thirty-six
Guelph and Ghibelline merchants. The members soon
began to hold daily discussions in their meeting-place, the
court of the Calimala, or Clothdressers' Guild. The
business of dressing foreign woollen stuffs had made great
progress in Florence, and the guild was more powerful
than any of the others. The council soon agreed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
the first measure proposed should be the conversion of
the seven greater guilds into an industrial and political
body, with special banners, weapons, and chiefs of its
own. So they began to organise all the details, assigning
a gonfalon to each guild, and arranging them as follows:
Judges and Notaries; Calimala, or Dressers of Foreign
Cloth; Woollen Trade; Money-changers; Physicians and
Druggists; Silk Trade, and Fur Trade. The Ghibellines,
however, foresaw that this course would inevitably lead
to the reconstruction of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Primo Popolo</span></i> under another
name. Accordingly the Uberti, Lamberti, Fifanti, and
Scolari decidedly opposed these innovations, and impressed
Count Guido with the necessity of putting a stop to them
at once if he wished to keep the government in his grasp.
This being precisely what the count most desired, he
instantly sent to demand aid from Ghibelline cities.
Arezzo, Sienna, Pisa, Pistoia, Colle, and San Gimignano
contributed some cavalry, which, with his German guard,
raised his forces to fifteen hundred. But, although these
troops were under Count Guido's command, they were
also at his expense; his Germans were already clamouring
for their pay, and all his money was spent. Accordingly,
while still negotiating terms of agreement with the people,
he decided to levy an additional income tax of ten per
cent. in Florence. But the citizens were already so
heavily burdened that this new impost was more than
small fortunes could support. The people were already
weary of misgovernment, and much irritated by the
count's action in stripping the Communal palace of its
armoury to enrich his own castle at Poppi; also being
encouraged by commercial success and increasingly hostile
to the Ghibellines, they now made vigorous protest, and
clearly showed their readiness to fly to arms. Then the
Council of Thirty-six tried to pacify the citizens, and
acting as mediators, proposed to undertake the collection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of the new tax, levying it in such wise as to make it fall
chiefly on the rich and powerful.</p>

<p>Just then, however, the nobles, emboldened by the
arrival of reinforcements, thought the moment had arrived
for a decisive blow, and rose to arms in the city. The
Lamberti took the initiative by rushing to the Piazza,
sword in hand, shouting, "Out with these thieves, the
Thirty-six; let us cut them to pieces!" At this outcry
all shops were closed; the Thirty-six broke up their
council, and the people rising in revolt took their orders
from them and from the consuls of the guilds, with
Giovanni Soldanieri as their leader-in-chief. The latter
was a patrician, urged by personal ambition to join the
riot at the head of the people. Concentrating in Piazza
St. Trinità, they were soon attacked by Count Guido
and his cavalry, who thought to make short work of them.
But, on the contrary, the crowd threw up barricades and
made a stubborn resistance, while such a storm of stones
and darts rained down from windows and roofs that the
Germans began to lose heart, and the count, stricken with
dismay, ordered his standards to withdraw, retreated to
Piazza St. Giovanni, and then hurrying to the two
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Gaudenti</span></i> in the Communal palace, demanded the keys
of the town in order to effect his escape. Neither his
friends' supplications nor the wrath of his followers could
persuade him that the danger was not serious, and that
he might safely remain in the town. He was so bewildered
by fear that, having obtained the keys, he
insisted on being escorted by three of the Thirty-six, lest
he should be shot from some window by the way. So,
on St. Martin's Day, November 11, 1266, he left Florence
by the so-called Gate of the Oxen, and fled with his
followers to Prato.</p>

<p>The following day, being cured of his panic, he perceived
his mistake, and by the advice of the Florentine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Ghibellines in his company tried, as Machiavelli puts it,
"to recapture by force the city he had forsaken from
<span class="locked">cowardice."<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span> He came with his men in order of battle
as far as the Gate by the Carraia Bridge, on the site
of the present Borgo Ognissanti; but the people who
could have scarcely succeeded in expelling him before,
save for his own exaggerated fears, had no difficulty in
repulsing him now. When the count demanded admission
with a mixture of threats and entreaties, the only
reply was a shower of arrows from the walls. He was
therefore compelled to retreat, and his men were so
enraged and humiliated that on the way back they tried
to capture a neighbouring castle in order to prove their
strength. But even this small attempt failed, and they
reached Prato more humbled than ever, and with much
dissension in their ranks. The count, convinced of the
hopelessness of recovering the state, sought refuge in the
Casentino, and the Florentine Ghibellines dispersed to
various fortresses and mansions about the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>The Guelphs were now masters of Florence. They
set to work at the changes required for the reorganisation
of the popular government, and were favoured with much
imperious advice from the Pope. However, they only
gave heed to his epistles in sufficient measure to avoid
exciting his wrath. Their first act was the dismissal of
the two <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Gaudenti</span></i> friars, whose incapacity had been well
proved; their next to request Orvieto to furnish them with
a Captain of the people, a Podestà, and a body of knights
to guard the safety of the Commune. Accordingly one
hundred knights arrived, with Messer Ormanno Monaldeschi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
as Podestà, and a Messer Bernardini as Captain.
For the sake of peace they allowed the Ghibellines to
return to Florence, and arranged various reconciliations
and marriages between them and the Guelphs, hoping
thus to promote unity among the people and mitigate
party hatred. But, in the still heated state of the public
mind, these measures only excited fresh rancour.</p>

<p>At this juncture Florence seemed to have lost all her
former self-reliance, so that, in the midst of the grave
complications of Italian politics, even the Guelphs felt
the need of foreign support. It was a fatal habit, first
owed to the Ghibellines, who, in token of respect toward
the Empire, had requested the presence of an Imperial
vicar in Florence. So, now that the people had won the
victory because the Angevins had succeeded the Suabian
line on the Neapolitan throne, recurrence to the same
perilous measure seemed almost unavoidable. The Pope,
with an assumption of Imperial prerogative, had nominated
Charles of Anjou, first as peacemaker, and then as actual
vicar-imperial, in Tuscany, for a term of ten years. The
Florentines considering it a duty to conform with this
new state of things, and even to accept it with a good
grace, accordingly offered Charles the lordship of their
city for six years, a term afterwards extended to ten.
But either because the conditions attached to the offer
were distasteful to the French monarch, or because he
wished it to be pressed more energetically, he certainly
showed much hesitation in deciding to accept it. Shortly
afterwards he despatched to Florence Philip de Monfort,
who made his entry with eight hundred knights on Easter
Day, 1267, the anniversary, as it was remarked at the
time, of Buondelmonti's assassination. The king subsequently
sent Guy de Monfort as his <span class="locked">vicar;<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></span> and at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
came in person to lead the war against the Ghibellines in
Tuscany.</p>

<p>The Ghibellines being now expelled, and the supremacy
of Charles accepted as an accomplished fact, the necessity
remained of establishing the government of Florence on a
definite basis, and endeavouring to secure its freedom
amid new and hazardous complications. To this end the
fourth constitution of the Republic was evolved. The
state of Florentine society had undergone considerable
change, and this implied a corresponding change in the
character of the new constitution. The Ghibelline or
patrician party was now reduced to a small number of
nobles, soldiers by profession, and eager to exercise
tyranny. But, as we have seen, almost a new aristocracy
had come to the front, composed of nobles, who, renouncing
their titles and altering their names, had joined
the popular side, and likewise of well-to-do burghers
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolo grasso</span></i>), who, having leapt to fortune as traders,
had now entered a new sphere of civil life, and dominated
the <span class="locked">city.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></span> Another point to be noted is that both
burghers and populace were rapidly losing their aptitude
for arms, and this not merely because in all wars of the
period the superiority of trained soldiers was a recognised
fact, and popular armies seen to be of small use, but
also because commerce had become too important for
busy traders, engaged in their shops or travelling about
the world, to be able, as in past times, to spend two or
three months of the year in the field. Commerce was
now the chief occupation and almost the very life of the
Florentines, so that they really deserved to be called a
people of bankers and merchants.</p>

<p>In addition to all this there was now a foreign power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
upheld by foreign soldiery in Florence. Whether in person
or by means of other officials of his own nomination,
Charles of Anjou filled the post of Podestà of the city,
and even the Captain of the people was often a man of his
choice. Therefore, with their usual sagacity, the Florentines
re-established the twelve elders, two for each <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestiere</span></i>,
under the name of the Twelve Worthies, as advisers to the
Podestà. Also, in place of the Thirty-six, they constituted
a council of one hundred worthies of the people, "without
whose sanction no important measure nor any
expenditure was to be undertaken." With this council
and with the parliament, which legally, at all events,
never ceased to exist in Florence, we see the reconstitution
of a central and popular government, limiting the
authority of the Angevin Podestà.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, almost a revival of the old consular
government by which the Podestà and Captain, now to be
made subordinate to it, had been originally raised to
power. Nor did matters stop at this point. The two
councils, special and general, of the Podestà and Captain
were likewise repristinated. With this difference, however,
that whereas by the constitution of 1250 the
Captain of the people had been second in command, and
then almost abolished under the Ghibelline sway, now at
this date he not only resumed his functions, but was given
precedence over the Podestà.</p>

<p>In fact, any Bill proposed by the Twelve to the Hundred
and approved by the latter, was passed on to the Captain's
two councils, in the first place to his special council of the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">capitudini</span></i>&mdash;also known as the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">credenza</span></i>&mdash;consisting, as
formerly, of eighty members. Approved by this assembly,
the Bill was then proposed to the council-general and special
and of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">capitudini</span></i>, comprising three hundred members.
As a rule, all the three councils put it to the vote the same
day. Then, on the following day, the Bill was presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
to both the councils of the Podestà, first to the special
council of ninety, next to the general council of three
hundred, sometimes increased to 390 by deliberating
jointly with the special assembly. We know very
little regarding the mode of election to these councils,
but they usually lasted six months. Nevertheless, as they
were very large and, on the other hand, the number of the
citizens was small, we opine that all eligible persons&mdash;<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">abili
a sedere</span></i>, namely, fully qualified citizens&mdash;must have been
chosen in turn. It should also be added that projected
motions were neither all nor invariably submitted to every
one of these different councils. Both by law and usage
the magistrates were often privileged to recur to certain
councils only, even as they were allowed the right of
assembling a preliminary and more restricted council of
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">richiesti</span></i> (or invited persons), composed solely of officials
or citizens whose experience might be useful in drawing
up the required schemes. At other times even a few outsiders
were invited to the councils. Thus, for instance,
when affairs of war were under discussion the presence
was requested of those charged to superintend them. The
statutes were neither very precise nor very stringent on
this point. Special efforts, however, seem to have been
used to put checks on free discussion, possibly to prevent
the multitude of councils from causing undue delay. The
right of proposing any measure or decree was strictly
reserved to magistrates, by whom some notary or
other qualified person was commissioned to support it in
their name. Save in very grave cases, the councillors only
said a few words before voting. The opposition was
never more than a small minority, partly because every
project brought before the councils had been already sifted
several times. Later on, while still allowing men to vote
against the magisterial proposals, no one was permitted to
speak save in their favour. Hence, in spite of possessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
so many public assemblies, Italy produced no real political
oratory, and in fact our literature is very poor in this
branch of eloquence. And another point should also be
noted here. The Council of One Hundred was entirely
plebeian, so too those of the Captain; on the other hand,
nobles, as well as plebeians, sat in the Podestà's councils.
The <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">capitudini</span></i>, or guild-masters, were always admitted,
as we have shown, to the Captain's councils, and very frequently
also to those of the Podestà. All this plainly
proves that the democratic party and the greater guilds
constituting its main nucleus were decidedly <span class="locked">predominant.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></span>
Thus, although King Charles obtained the lordship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
of Florence, his power was fettered by so many
restrictions that all administrative authority remained
vested in the people, and particularly in the well-to-do
burgher class (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolo grasso</span></i>).</p>

<p>The new laws examined by us contain very few allusions
to Guelphs and Ghibellines, many to nobles and people
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> and <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i>); for party conflict was beginning
to wear its real name, and plainly signified the struggle
between the aristocracy and democracy. Nevertheless, the
Ghibelline faction still survived and constituted in fact the
aristocratic party. For this reason the people desired its
total destruction, and another clause of the new constitution
aimed at the same result. A list was drawn up of
all who had suffered persecution from the Ghibellines
between 1260 and 1266, together with an inventory of
their confiscated property. The number of victims was
found to be very great, and their losses to amount to
the then enormous sum of 132,160,8,4 <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
accordingly resolved to treat the Ghibellines in the same
way, and during the years 1268 and 1269 about three
thousand were condemned, including contumacious rebels,
and as many sentences of confiscation pronounced, which
remained enforced for a long <span class="locked">period.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></span> At first, all confiscated
property was collected to form a so-called "<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">monte</span></i>,"
or fund; then afterwards it became the custom to divide
this into three parts: one to the Commune; one to individual
Guelphs as indemnity for past losses; and the
other third to the party, in order to strengthen it at the
Ghibellines' expense. In course of time, however, almost
all confiscated estates were granted to the party alone, and
their administration entrusted to six governors, chosen for
the purpose, three of whom were nobles and three men of
the people. These officials were originally styled consuls
of the knights, then captains of the Guelph party, in
deference to the ill-omened counsels of Pope Clement IV.
and Charles of Anjou. As every important magistracy of
the time was associated with two councils, so the Captains
of the party also possessed a special or privy council of
fourteen, and a council-general of sixty <span class="locked">members.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></span> The
Captains kept office for two months, and held their sittings
in the Church of Sta. Maria sopra Porta. Later on they
had a palace of their own, and were entrusted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
superintendence of public works, of the officials of the
Towers, and other functions of a similar kind. But their
chief duty was always to promote the cause and persecute
Ghibellines. They performed their task with so much
zeal, pursuing their adversaries so fiercely, that at last the
ruling spirit among the Captains of the party was the
virtual ruler of Florence. By excluding all opponents
from public posts, sentencing them to exile, and confiscating
their goods, these functionaries rose to increasing
power, and injured the Republic they served.</p>

<p>Taking a general view of the new constitution, with
all its intricate multiplicity of councils and magistracies,
our first impression is that all was confusion and arbitrary
rule. But on looking more closely into the purpose for
which it had been formed, we are obliged to admit that
this government was singularly well adapted for success.
Civil war is not yet stamped out: on the contrary, must
undoubtedly continue for a long time; democracy is
pressing on towards the fulness of its triumph and the
complete destruction of the aristocracy. Nor will democracy
be satisfied with ousting the nobles from the government
of the republics, but will seek to deprive them of
life itself, and this is only to be accomplished by much
bloodshed and many revolutions.</p>

<p>In the new political organisation, the central power, soon
to be changed every two months, occupies a very feeble
position compared with the high importance, permanence,
and strength now assigned to the Podestà and the Captain.
These officers are at the head of the Commune and the
people; each of them presides over two councils: they are,
as it were, the chiefs of two armed and hostile republics.
But in that of the people, hitherto the weaker, no patrician
is admitted; while in that of the Commune, the
people has assumed a very important position relatively
to that of the nobles, and therefore has legally obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
the casting vote in all decisions, notwithstanding the
supremacy virtually exercised by Charles of Anjou in
moments of the gravest emergency. It is easy to foresee
the bitterness of strife to be engendered by this state of
things. If we likewise remember that this Republic, as
though foredoomed to civil war, included so important a
magistracy as the Captains of the party, apparently created
for the sole purpose of perpetuating discord, as an engine
of war, serving to keep all these heterogeneous forces in
continual agitation and promote ceaseless bloodshed and
destruction, we can understand the course of coming
events in Florence. We must be prepared for continual
struggles, restless changes of institutions and laws, prepared
to behold webs carefully woven one month pulled
to pieces before the next moon begins to wane. Nevertheless,
the whole machinery of the government was
singularly fitted to compass the end that the Republic
from the first had constantly in view.</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Much more, however, remains to be said in order to
give our readers a lucid and adequate idea of the Constitution
and society of Florence in the latter half of the
thirteenth century. So far we have dwelt too slightly
on the most important detail of the new reforms&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the
organisation of the guilds. The measures suggested for
this purpose by the Thirty-six from their first meetings in
the Calimala Court, and against which the nobles had
most strongly protested, were speedily approved by the
people, and from that moment became the chief basis of
the Florentine statutes. Associations of arts and trades
had existed throughout Italy from a very early date, and
had soon attained greater development in Florence than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
in other communes. For, as we have had occasion to
note, the whole life of the people was concentrated in
these associations when the Ghibelline tyranny, upheld by
Manfred, excluded the lower classes from participation in
the government of the city. Therefore all that was done
now was to embody naturally evolved results in a more
regular and legal shape. Only the greater guilds, seven
in number, had risen to any really great political importance
in 1260; the others had to wait much longer before
being reorganised on the same footing. What was the
position attained by the seven greater guilds at the moment
we are now studying? By devoting our attention to the
guild that was first and foremost in the race it will serve
as a model, and enlighten us as to the others.</p>

<p>At the period of which we treat the fine arts flourished
in Italy side by side with trade, and this was not only
advantageous to the national culture, but already enabled
our manufactures to dictate the laws of taste to all Europe.
In those times Florence, <span class="locked">Milan,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></span> and Venice set the
fashions, as Paris sets them now. The fine Italian taste
helped to create the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Calimala</span></i><a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> trade, and secured its rapid
prosperity. This trade was the art of dressing foreign
cloths&mdash;from Flanders, France, and England&mdash;and dyeing
them with colours known to Florence alone. Then, in
their finished state, these stuffs were sent to all the European
markets stamped with the mark of the Calimala
Guild. This mark was highly prized as a proof of good
quality, as showing that the exact length of the pieces
had been scrupulously verified in Florence, and as a
guarantee against any falsification of material. It is
therefore easy to see why the Calimala merchants had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
trading relations with all Europe, and interests extending
to every place where civilisation and luxury were known.</p>

<p>Hence the necessity, even in early times, of choosing
directors of the guild, framing statutes, and appointing
consuls abroad as well as at home, to protect its undertakings.
Now, however, with the newly inaugurated
reforms, the Calimala, together with the other greater
guilds, was constituted on the lines of a miniature <span class="locked">republic.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></span></p>

<p>Every six months, <i>i.e.</i>, in June and December, the
heads of warehouses and shops held a meeting, and this
<i>Union</i>&mdash;exercising much the same function in the guild as
that of the parliament in the Republic&mdash;chose the electors
to be charged with the nomination of the magistrates.
First came four consuls, who administered justice according
to the statutes, acted as representatives of the guild,
and ruled it with the assistance of two councils, one being
a special council with a minimum of twelve members, and
the other a general assembly often varying in number and
sometimes limited to eighteen. With the consent of these
councils the consuls were even empowered to alter the
statutes. They carried the banner of the guild, and in
emergencies the citizens assembled at arms under their
command. Then there was the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">camarlingo</span></i>, or chamberlain,
holding office for one year, who administered the
revenue and expenditure of the association. And even as
the Republic had a foreign magistrate in the person of the
Podestà, so the guild had one also in the person of its
notary, likewise appointed for one year. He was chosen
by the council-general, had to speak in both councils as
the representative of the consuls; was often employed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
missions for the guild, and was specially charged to enforce
scrupulous observation of the statutes, with the power of
inflicting severe punishment on all violators of the same,
were they even the consuls themselves. All these officials
were sworn adherents of the Guelph party. The notary's
stipend was fixed from year to year. The consuls were
bound to accept office if elected, and could not be re-elected
under an interval of one year; their salary was first
fixed at ten <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>, and the product of certain fines; but
was afterwards reduced to several pounds of pepper and
saffron, and a few wooden baskets and spoons. The
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">camarlingo</span></i>, or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">camerario</span></i>, was remunerated even more
slightly, and much in the same way. Three accountants
were chosen every year to investigate the actions of the
outgoing consuls, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">camarlingo</span></i>, and other magistrates.
Twelve statutory merchants were similarly elected, with
authority to revise and improve the statutes of the guild;
but all reforms suggested by them had to be approved
first by both councils, and then by the Captain of the
people. The consuls who, under the title of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">capitudini</span></i>,
took part in the councils of the Captain and Podestà, were
pledged to protect the interests of the guild and advocate
laws in its favour. But what were these statutes for the
good of the trade of which so many magistrates enforced
the observance? They prescribed fixed rules and regulations
for the exercise of the business. Very severe punishments
were enacted when the merchandise was of bad
quality, defective, or counterfeit. Every piece of cloth
was bound to be labelled, and any stain or rent unrecorded
by this label entailed punishment on the merchant concerned.
Above all, there was great strictness as to exactness
of measure. The officers of the guild frequently
inspected the cloth, and made a bi-monthly examination
of the measures used in all the shops. Models of the
prescribed measures were exhibited to the public in certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
parts of the city. Nor was this all. The consuls sent
delegates to every counting-house to verify the merchants'
books and accounts, and punished every deviation from
established rules. Every guild had a tribunal composed
either solely of its own members, or jointly with those
of another, for the settlement of all disputes connected
with the trade, and enforced severe penalties on all who
referred such disputes to ordinary courts. It may be
asked how the consuls were enabled to give effect to their
verdicts? The punishments were generally fines, and
persons refusing to pay them, after receiving several
admonitions and increased fines if still recalcitrant, were
excluded from the guild and practically ruined. From
that moment their merchandise, being unstamped, was
no longer guaranteed by the guild; they also lost many
other notable advantages, and were finally unable to continue
their business in Florence, and not often elsewhere.
In fact, as we have seen, the consuls chosen in Florence
guarded the interests of the guild even outside the State
by deputing vice-consuls for that purpose to other parts
of Italy and Europe, and increasing their number in proportion
with the increase of their commercial relations.
The two more important consuls abroad were those in
France. All these delegates were charged with even the
choice of the inns to be frequented by the members of the
guild. Whenever, according to the usage of the day, any
state exercised reprisals on the members' goods, the consuls
were bound to assist and defend them. Thus,
wherever he might be, a member of the guild was sure
of protection from every sort of injury or loss. The
guild was a jealous custodian of its members' rights, and,
in order to defend them in foreign countries or to obtain
justice for injuries received, often despatched ambassadors
to the governments <span class="locked">concerned.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></span> This was an invaluable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
help at a time when no international law existed for the
protection of foreigners, and reprisals were continually
used. Accordingly merchants found it better to submit
to any penalty rather than be dismissed from the guild;
no worse threat was needed to enforce obedience to the
statutes. The six other greater guilds were all governed
on the same principle as the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Calimala</span></i>. Their united body
of consuls formed the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">capitudini</span></i>, and these were afterwards
headed by a proconsul, a magistrate held in the
highest esteem.</p>

<p>Putting aside the immense commercial and industrial
advantages that this organisation of the guilds afforded
to the Republic during the thirteenth century, we shall
see that they were equally useful from the political point
of view. All these merchants, constituting a large
majority of the citizens, were continually engaged in
directing great undertakings, settling commercial disputes,
discussing statutes and laws; they maintained
relations with all parts of the known world, and travelled
to all parts on special missions in defence of their common
interests. We see that they all took a continuous and
eager share in political life, inasmuch as every guild was
an independent, self-ruling institution, with separate
magistrates, laws, statutes, and councils, and that it
became a centre of industrial, intellectual, and political
activity. Thanks to this freedom of circulation, the
pulse of the Florentine people was quickened to
redoubled strength, and every faculty of the human
mind, all moral and political energy of which man is
capable, suddenly rose to a prodigious height in Florence.
Choosing any one of these merchants almost at random,
one might be sure to find him capable of governing the
Republic; a man to be trusted with the most delicate of
diplomatic missions, and honourably acquit himself of it;
one able to command a respectful hearing from Pope, king,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
or emperor, without allowing himself to be duped, yet
without failing to conform to the requirements of court
ceremonial. Thus the Florentines rose to great fame
throughout Europe for their shrewdness and subtlety, and
as in the midst of all this extraordinary commercial and
political activity Italian art and literature also developed,
the small mercantile Republic soon shed its lustre over
the whole world.</p>

<p>The greater guilds also achieved another good result
in Florence. At a time when the State organisation
divided the city in two halves, as it were; at a time when
the strife of factions was about to be fiercely renewed,
when party leaders excited men's passions by nourishing
the flame of discord, and the continual change of the
supreme Council of Twelve transferred the direction
of the government to citizens of all tempers, and all
devoted to their respective parties, then the decentralisation
of the government in a large number of small associations
was indeed an inestimable benefit. If nobles or
people rebelled against their rulers in order to change the
Twelve, or the Podestà, the Captain, or even the statutes,
the suspension of public business that inevitably ensued
produced much less real than apparent confusion. Being
split up into so many small associations, the Republic
could exist without a government even for several months;
since the armed, disciplined, and strongly constituted guilds,
were now even better prepared than in past times to seize
the reins, and prevent the troubles which would have
certainly befallen the city had it been left without
guidance. Thus the constitution of the guilds, as
established in 1266, likewise serves to explain how it was
that poetry, painting, sculpture, and architecture were
enabled to flourish among a people of traders; even as it
explains why so much progress was possible amid such,
apparently, enormous confusion, and how democracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
succeeded in destroying every relic of feudalism in
Florence, and in achieving absolute equality together
with the highest degree of freedom known to the Middle
Ages. The Florentine Commune was the centre of so
much culture because it was also the seat of the largest
freedom compatible with the times. Of this culture the
best and loveliest fruits are owed to the democracy;
for we find in Arnolfo's towers and churches, in the
paintings of Cimabue and Giotto, as also in Dante's verse,
the special stamp and characteristic of the Florentine
people. During the Middle Ages in Provence, France,
Germany, and England, many nobles rose to literary
fame, and indeed nearly all the poets of those lands were
of patrician birth. But Florentine art and letters, constituting
the most fertile seeds of art and letters in Italy,
were essentially republican; many writers, and most of
the artists, of Florence were the offspring of traders or
labouring men.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div><img src="images/i_a.jpg" class="drop-capi" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">AFTER</span> the death of Frederic II., the
Imperial throne long remained vacant.
For twenty-three years no king of the
Romans was definitively proclaimed in
Germany, and sixty-two years elapsed
before any prince came to Rome to
assume the crown of the Empire. Therefore during this
interval the Ghibelline party was left to its own resources,
and its leaders tried to maintain their feudal
rights by employing their forces and prestige against
all communes and small potentates enjoying no chance
of gaining the Imperial protection. Hence petty
tyrants began to arise on all sides, Ghibelline lords for
the most part, who, notwithstanding the many defeats
endured by the aristocracy in Italy, derived new and
unexpected advantages from the changed conditions of
the times. Another factor of this result was the new
mode of warfare. Men-at-arms were now the chief
strength of an army, and these mounted soldiers, cased as
well as their horses, in heavy armour and armed with long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
spears, were able to overcome infantry before the latter's
halberds could come into play. But a lengthy training
was required for cavalry service, and it was increasingly
difficult for artisans or merchants to pursue the military
career to any effect, whereas war was becoming the
chief occupation of the nobles. In fact, many of the
leading patricians were acquiring a reputation in the new
mode of war, gaining followers, and by taking the command
of small companies gradually rising to power, and
aspiring to become tyrants. For this and other reasons,
to be made clearer farther on, nearly all the Lombard
cities, and some of those in Central Italy, were now losing
their independence.</p>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 241.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>The same ambitions doubtless existed among the
Guelphs, but the feudal aristocracy had far less influence
in their party, the majority of which consisted of merchants
and wealthy men of the people. Besides, the Pope
was a near neighbour during the interregnum of the
Empire, the Guelph cities were at the same time under
the dangerous protection of an ambitious pontiff, and that
of the equally ambitious Charles I. of Anjou, peacemaker
and vicar-imperial of Tuscany. Charles nominated the
Podestà of every Guelph Tuscan city, and whenever he
failed to appear in person, sent a representative, called by
the chroniclers a royal <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">maliscalco</span></i>, with an escort of some
hundred horse and foot. Pisa, Arezzo, and all other
Ghibelline cities refusing to acknowledge his authority,
were exposed to continual threats from without, and
lacerated within their walls by the attacks of would-be
tyrants. On the other hand, the Guelph cities lived in
continual terror of the king's ambitious designs; but
Charles's position was not sufficiently assured for him
to be able to use his temporary and limited office as a
pretext for asserting sovereign power over Tuscany,
although such was his secret aim. For the moment it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
was enough to play the part of high protector of all
civic rights and privileges, so that the Guelph cities
might be tricked into counting on his help both against
Ghibelline attacks from without and internal treason in
favour of tyranny.</p>

<p>The Florentines, however, were not easily hoodwinked
regarding either future or present events. They had
asked Charles to accord them his protection, but only
within certain limits, which, at any cost, they were determined
should not be overstepped. They too nourished a
secret aim&mdash;namely, to use the king's forces, not for the
increase of his power, but towards the establishment of
their own supremacy in Tuscany. The authority of the
Empire was much diminished in Italy; the temporal
strength of the Papacy was also on the wane, and the
Communes, realising their greater independence, hastened
to enlarge their respective territories. All Italian cities
now had this end in view. But if one city waxed powerful,
all its neighbours had either to pursue the same
course or become its prey. Thus there was continual
war between this and that city, less from party strife or
jealousy than in necessary defence of their own interests.
Besides, with the new custom of hiring foreign soldiers and
captains of adventure, any one with gold at his command
could quickly collect a powerful force and attack some of
his neighbours. Hence every city or state had to be
always on the alert and continually enlarging its strength
and power. It was for this purpose that the Florentines
now resolved to turn to account the authority, prestige,
and forces of King Charles.</p>

<p>Accordingly when (1267) his mandatories, the Podestà
Emilio di <span class="locked">Corbano,<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></span> and Marshal Philip de <span class="locked">Montfort,<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
with eight hundred French knights, arrived in Florence, a
Florentine army, composed of recruits from two <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestieri</span></i>
of the city, in junction with the French cavalry under
Montfort, immediately marched to the siege of St. Ilario,
or St. Ellero, in which castle a number of Ghibellines had
sought refuge with their leader, Filippo da Volognano.
The castle was taken, and its eight hundred Ghibelline
defenders were all either killed or <span class="locked">captured.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></span> They comprised
many members of the highest Florentine nobility,
Uberti, Fifanti, Scolari, &amp;c., and party hatred was then
so fierce that a youthful scion of the Uberti, finding
surrender inevitable, threw himself from the top of a
tower to avoid falling into the hands of the <span class="locked">Buondelmonti.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></span>
In the course of this campaign the castles of
Campi and Gressa were captured; and many cities,
including Lucca, Pistoia, Volterra, Prato, San Gimignano,
and Colle, being won over to the Guelph cause by the
expulsion of their Ghibellines, joined the Florentines in
the League, or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Taglia</span></i>, commanded by the French
marshal.</p>

<p>Pisa and Sienna still remained Ghibelline; the former
had always been and still continued to be the strongest
bulwark of the party in Tuscany; the latter had, as usual,
given refuge to the banished Ghibellines of Florence, and
also to some of Manfred's Germans who had escaped the
massacre of Benevento. The Florentines had not yet
succeeded in revenging the rout of Montaperti, and were
burning to pluck this thorn from their side; while King
Charles, equally eager for the destruction of all surviving
friends and supporters of the Suabian line, was preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
to come to Tuscany to lead the war against Sienna in
person. Pending his arrival, the Florentines, after an
abortive attack on the city, laid waste the surrounding
territory, and finding that the exiles, the Germans and
other Ghibellines, were entrenched at Poggibonsi, marched
against that town with the French contingent and the
Guelphs of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Taglia</span></i>, and began preparations for a
regular siege. At the same time King Charles entered
Florence, and was naturally welcomed with great joy.
All the chief citizens went forth to meet him, with the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i>, as a sign of the highest honour, and after
spending a festal week in the city and raising several
persons to the knighthood, the king repaired to the camp
before Poggibonsi. The siege lasted four months, and
then, towards the middle of December, 1267, the stronghold
was driven to surrender by famine. Charles left a
Podestà there to govern in his name, and began to build
a fortress, providing for that expense, in his accustomed
way, by levying heavy taxes from the cities of the League.
Florence had to contribute 1,992 <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>. After this, the
army was immediately marched against Pisa. The reduction
of this powerful and warlike republic proved no
easy task; the king had to be satisfied for the time with
humiliating it, by seizing Porto Pisano and levelling the
towers there. In February, 1268, he repaired to Lucca,
and marching thence to the siege of Mutrone, captured
that castle and gave it to the Lucchese. Thus, by a
series of small victories, which, although of slight importance,
were achieved with dazzling rapidity, he greatly
raised the authority and prestige of the Guelph party,
which had not only contributed troops to the war, but
borne its entire expense, granting all the large sums of
money continually demanded by their imperious protector.
In fact, by the end of February, 1268, Florence
alone had disbursed no less than seventy-two thousand <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
twenty thousand of which were devoted to the reduction
of Poggibonsi, although Charles had not fulfilled his
promise of erecting a fortress there. But at this moment
a war-cry was raised, stirring all Italy to alarm, and the
monarch was suddenly threatened by so imminent a peril,
that after some hesitation he was compelled to decide on
flying to the defence of the Neapolitan kingdom.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Prince Conradin, son of Conrad, and grandson of
Frederic II., was the last representative of the Suabian
line in Germany, and the last hope of the Ghibellines in
Italy. He was rightful heir to the crown of Naples that
Charles of Anjou had forcibly usurped; and in many
quarters he was regarded as the future emperor of
Germany. On attaining the age of fifteen years, numerous
exiles, from Naples, Sicily and other parts of Italy, sought
his presence, imploring him to reconquer his kingdom
and restore the Imperial party in Italy. Conradin was a
youth of precocious intelligence, full of ardour and
ambition; so, fired by this flash of hope, he instantly
resolved to cross the Alps. Selling what little property
remained to him, and collecting the most devoted of his
adherents, he gathered a small army and entered Verona
on the 20th of October, with three thousand horse and
a considerable number of infantry. From this city he
despatched letters to all the Christian powers, recounting
his misfortunes: the injuries inflicted on him by the
usurpation of King Charles and the hatred of Pope
Urban IV., who, not content with summoning a French
pretender to trample on the Imperial rights, had gone to
the length of excommunicating the legitimate heirs of the
Empire itself. By way of reply, Pope Clement now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
renewed the sentence of excommunication on Conradin,
tried to stir all the powers against him by means of
violent and venomous epistles; and wrote pressingly to
Charles, now waiting to give battle in Tuscany, bidding
him hasten to defend his kingdom from the threatened
and imminent danger. In fact, the Ghibelline movement
was now spreading throughout Italy. Pisa and Sienna were
roused to great hopes, for the cities of Romagna, Naples,
and especially of Sicily, had all risen against the French.
By April, 1268, Conradin was already in Pisa with his
army, and numerous adherents flocked to his standard,
although the emptiness of his purse had caused some of
the Germans to desert. By this time Charles had reached
Naples, was making preparations for defence, and laying
siege to Lucera, where Manfred's Saracens had hoisted the
Suabian flag. Conradin was ready to fly thither, without
even halting in Tuscany to encourage the cities revolted
in his favour. Pisa and Sienna openly sided with him;
Poggibonsi had promptly thrown off the Florentine yoke;
and other places were preparing to do the same. Meanwhile,
the German troops at once directed their march on
Rome, where the Senator Errico of Castile was awaiting
them. The French in Florence sallied forth to intercept
their passage, but were driven back with heavy loss, to
the great encouragement of Conradin and his followers.</p>

<p>But the prince's fate was to be decided by the battle
of Tagliacozzo, fought near the banks of the Salto on
August 23, 1268. At the beginning of the engagement
Charles's inferior forces seemed almost routed, so that the
German horse rode forward on all sides in pursuit. But
while all were scattered, riding down and pillaging their
retreating foes, Charles suddenly fell on them with the
reserve of eight hundred horse he had kept in ambush,
and quickly turned the fortunes of the day. The same
evening, in a frenzy of delight, he announced his victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
to the Pope, who was equally exultant. The prisoners
were treated with unparalleled cruelty, being mutilated,
beheaded, or even burnt alive. Conradin escaped with
about five hundred men, and escorted by Henry of
Austria, Galvano Lancia, Count Gherardo Donatico of
Pisa, and other devoted friends, made for Rome. But
being then deserted by most of his followers, he had to
fly to the Maremma and seek shelter in the Castle of
Astura. But here, by the sea, when on the point of
embarking for Sicily with a handful of friends, he was
seized by Giovanni Frangipani, lord of Astura, who
handed him over to Charles, and was rewarded by grants
of land.</p>

<p>The French monarch hastened to manifest his joy by
renewed acts of cruelty. It is said that one of the
towers of Corneto was garlanded with the corpses of
some of the most distinguished and valiant Ghibellines.
In all the Neapolitan cities he excited the populace to the
fiercest excesses against the nobles of Conradin's party.
And his ministers in Sicily outrivalled one another in
ferocity, for it is said that, among other barbarities, so
many unhappy Sicilians were put to death in one day at
Augusta, that the executioner became exhausted with
fatigue, and wine was poured down his throat to give
him strength to continue the slaughter. But the king's
ferocious mind was chiefly devoted to considering what
should be Conradin's fate. To murder thousands of
fellow Christians, and let them die amid the worst
torments, was a matter of very slight consequence to
him; but where a victim of royal and Imperial blood
was in question, he felt obliged to hesitate a little.
In fact, it is said that he sought counsel from the Pope;
but then, without waiting the reply, he sought to give an
honest colour to his revenge by investing it with a false
air of legality. He presumed to treat the rival whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
throne he had usurped as one who had rebelled against
a legitimate sovereign, and to treat a prisoner of war as
a criminal guilty of high treason, and justly responsible
for all the excesses of the German soldiery during the
campaign. Yet, although the tribunal consisted of foes
of the Hohenstauffen selected by the king, some of its
members spoke nobly in Conradin's defence. It was
affirmed that Guido du Suzzara, a juris-consult of Emilia,
renowned in his day, pleaded the youthfulness of the
accused, his belief in his own right to the Neapolitan
crown, the motives of the campaign. It was also
reported that many of the judges remained silent, and
that one alone openly declared against the prisoner. But
all was in vain. Charles, who had already put some of
the barons to death, and forced one of them, Count
Galvano Lancia, to witness the strangling of his own
son before being executed, never intended the trial to be
more than a sham, so, choosing to interpret the judges'
silence as a sign of consent to the prince's death, gave
sentence accordingly. The verdict was communicated to
Conradin in prison while he was playing chess with his
cousin Frederic of Austria. On October 29, 1268,
both were led to the scaffold on the Market Place at
Naples. The protonotary Roberto di Bari, counsel for
the prosecution, read the sentence aloud, in the presence
of the exultant King Charles. It is asserted that even
many of the French were stirred to rage and humiliation
by this cruel scene. An immense throng filled the Piazza,
and many fell on their knees touched with pity. Conradin
removed his cloak, glanced at the silent people, threw
his glove to them, as an augury of vengeance in time to
come, and then submitted his neck to the axe. Thus
died the Emperor Frederic's heir, the last of the Suabian
line. Frederic of Austria tried to kiss his cousin's head,
but was instantly seized by the executioner and put to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
the same death. Many details, either historical or legendary,
are added by the chroniclers in describing this
dismal tragedy. Although a Guelph, Villani believed
the false rumour (vii. 29) to the effect that Count Robert
of Flanders, son-in-law to Charles, on hearing the
sentence read by di Bari, was moved to such fury that
he drew his sword and slew the protonotary forthwith
before the king's eyes. At least, this tale serves to show
what was the general impression produced by the deed.
Opinions vary as to the Pope's share in the tragedy. It
is certain that he beheld it in <span class="locked">silence.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Although these events excited general and very severe
condemnation in Italy, they wrought immediate benefit to
Charles and the Guelphs. The Florentines profited by
the opportunity to launch new sentences against the
Ghibellines, and shortly afterwards prepared to make
fresh attacks on their neighbours, and particularly on
Sienna. For they still yearned to avenge the defeat at
Montaperti, and were now additionally irritated by seeing
their exiles again flocking to Sienna, and heartily welcomed
there. They also held that city responsible for
the recent revolt of Poggibonsi, and their action in
devastating the latter's territory sufficed to start hostilities
afresh. The hopes of the Siennese had been greatly
inflamed by Conradin's passage, and even now they were
not disposed to be easily worsted. The chief ruler of the
city was still Provenzano Salvani, one of those who had
advised the battle of Montaperti and given notable proofs
of valour in the fight. Since then his fame had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
increased by many noble deeds. It was said that when
a friend of his was seized by King Charles and condemned
to pay a fine of ten thousand crowns in exchange for his
life, Provenzano came to the rescue, and as neither he nor
the prisoner's kindred could contrive to pay the ransom,
he stretched a carpet on the Piazza and stood there,
asking public alms for his friend until the required sum
was collected. Consequently he had great influence with
the people, was a Ghibelline and the declared enemy
of Florence. Sienna likewise contained a considerable
number of Spaniards and Germans, old soldiers of the
Ghibelline wars, and there was also Count Guido Novello,
who, although of little worth, continually agitated in
favour of hostilities. Thus an army was recruited, consisting,
Villani says, of fourteen hundred horse and eight
thousand foot, and this force besieged the Castle of Colle
in Val d'Elsa, as a reprisal for the devastation of Poggibonsi.
Thereupon the Florentines took the field with
a small body of infantry, led by the vicar of King
Charles, and eight hundred horse, and notwithstanding
their inferiority of numbers advanced against the Siennese,
gave them battle (June 17, 1269), and achieved their
defeat. Count Guido Novello secured his safety, as
usual, by flight; but Provenzano Salvani justified his
fame by dying sword in hand. His head was carried
round the field on the point of a spear. This was the
fulfilment of a prophecy made to him before the battle:
"Thy head shall be the highest in the field," although he
had interpreted the saying as an omen of success. The
Siennese received no quarter from their foes, who returned
home in triumph, and thinking they had now avenged the
rout of Montaperti, began negotiations for peace. The
first condition exacted was that Sienna should no longer
harbour Ghibelline refugees, who, in fact, were soon compelled
to depart and wander from place to place, everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
exposed to persecution and cruelty. Among others
were the Pazzi, who, having excited the Castle of Ostina
to revolt, were seized and hacked to pieces.</p>

<p>After a devastating raid on Pisan territory, executed by
the Florentines and Lucchese, Pisa signed a treaty of
peace with Charles in April, 1270. Florence herself
concluded an alliance with that republic on the 2nd of
May, stipulating almost the identical terms and the same
politico-commercial agreements previously arranged by the
peace of <span class="locked">1256.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></span> Just at that time Azzolino, Neracozzo,
and Conticino degli Uberti, together with a knight named
Bindo dei Grifoni, left Sienna to take refuge in the Casentino,
and were captured by the Florentines on the way.
The latter asked Charles what should be done with these
prisoners, and he replied, that they were to be punished
as traitors, save Conticino the youngest, who was to be
sent to him. The others were speedily beheaded, by
order of the Podestà Berardino d'Ariano (May 8, 1270).
It is related that on nearing the scaffold Neracozzo said
to Azzolino: "Whither are we going?" To which his
kinsman quietly replied: "To pay a debt bequeathed us
by our fathers." Conticino perished in a Capuan dungeon.
This instance clearly proves the great supremacy exercised
by Charles over the Commonwealth. But the Florentines
were willing to tolerate anything from him in order to
assure their predominance in Tuscany by his help, and
restore the prestige of the Guelph party. The latter aim
was already practically achieved, for all Tuscany now
adhered to the Guelphs, and both old and recent injuries
had been avenged. At this time Florence also demolished
the Castle of Pian di Mezzo in the Val d'Arno and razed
the walls of Poggibonsi.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, the power of the Angevins had
swelled to a formidable extent. Charles was firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
established on the Neapolitan throne; and during the
interregnum had been nominated by the Popes senator of
Rome and vicar-imperial of Romagna as well as Tuscany.
Accordingly, while restoring the strength of the Guelph
party, he had notably aggrandised his own authority.
His lurking ambition to be master of all Italy was now
clearly discernible, and accordingly the Florentines began
to kick against his perpetual interference, and to object
to every commune being subject to a Podestà of his
choice exercising absolute judicial power in his name
and under his authority. And as though this were not
enough, there was also a royal marshal or vicar in
Tuscany who jointly with the rest perpetually harassed
the city by threatening demands for fresh subsidies. But
even greater than elsewhere was the jealousy excited in
Rome. The Popes had summoned the Angevins to the
overthrow of the Suabians, less on account of these being
Ghibellines, those Guelphs, than because the Suabians had
entertained the identical ambition that Charles was now
beginning to conceive. Accordingly, there was now the
same motive for combating him.</p>

<p>Niccolò Machiavelli has often repeated that the Popes
"always feared every one who rose to great power in
Italy, albeit his power was exercised by favour of the
Church. And inasmuch as they [the Popes] sought to
lower that power, frequent tumults would arise and
frequent changes of power, since fear of a tyrant led
to the exaltation of some feebler personage, and then, as
his power became increased, he in turn was feared, and,
being feared, his overthrow was desired. Thus, the
government taken from Manfred was conceded to Charles;
thus, later, when he excited fear, his ruin likewise was
<span class="locked">planned."<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span> In fact, Urban IV. had invited Charles to
seize the kingdom of Naples; Clement IV. had named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
him his vicar; Gregory X. was now beginning to oppose
him, and succeeding pontiffs followed his example. Thus
three different political games were now being played in
Central Italy: the Angevins already yearning for the
dominion of Italy; the Florentines scheming to use the
French monarch's power to assure their own predominance
in Tuscany; and the Popes seeking to check the king's
ambition and resume their former supremacy over that
state.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The first sign of this alteration in the Papal policy was
quickly detected by Florence, although Rome used every
device to conceal the real cause and object of the change;
and, indeed, to prevent its change of purpose from appearing
on the surface. Gregory X. began by expressing regret
that a city so rich and powerful as Florence should still
be divided by the party strife of the Guelphs and Ghibellines.
He desired to see them at peace. No wish should
have seemed more natural on the part of the Head of
the Church; but it roused the king's suspicions to find
the Pope suddenly inflamed by such unusual compassion
towards the Ghibellines. His distrust was heightened
on seeing how cheerfully the Florentines accepted the
proposals of the Pope. They had already shown signs
of wishing to shake off the royal yoke by requesting the
king to give them an Italian Podestà, as their statutes
required, and already in January, <span class="locked">1270,<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></span> he had felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
obliged to make this concession in a graciously worded
decree. Instantly divining the real intention of Rome,
the Florentines now understood that the moment had
come to second it for their own advantage. They were
all the more willing to do so not only to impose a check
on the growing tyranny of the king, but in order to
remedy another evil wrought by his supremacy in
Florence. Charles was always surrounded by his own
barons and captains, whose foreign presence was unwelcome,
and by Guelph nobles and knights not only of
Tuscany, but from other parts of Italy as well. In
Florence he constantly favoured the old Guelph nobility,
and on every visit to the city created new knights. Thus,
ennobled Guelph merchants were joined to the other
aristocrats, and assuming the rank of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>, soon became
opposed to the people, and revived the old antipathy
of the Florentine democrats, who, just as they had
rebelled in past times against the feudal pride of the
Ghibellines, now refused to tolerate that of the old and
new Guelph patriciate. Therefore it was necessary to
curb the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> at any cost, and it seemed the wisest
plan to recall the Ghibellines, who were equally opposed
to them and the king. Thus the people would be
strengthened by the division of the nobles, and the latter,
by quarrelling among themselves, would lessen the number
of those most subservient to Charles. The king, however,
could not be blind to the hidden purpose of these intrigues,
and was quite awake to the Pope's real intentions. He
knew that the latter was now urging the Germans to elect
Rudolf of Hapsburg as King of the Romans, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
put an end to the Imperial interregnum, and consequently
to his own tenure of the vicariate. Why should the Pope
desire the election of an emperor save for the purpose of
weakening the Angevin power? Meanwhile both pontiff
and king preserved a feint of amity, and seemed to
be on the best possible terms, although their mutual distrust
continually flashed forth.</p>

<p>Gregory X. had decreed the convocation of a Council
at Lyons in 1274 in order to promote a crusade against
the infidels; and reaching Florence on June 18, 1273,
suspended his journey for awhile for the purpose, as he
said, of re-establishing the general peace. He arrived
with his whole train of cardinals and prelates, accompanied
by the Emperor of Byzantium, Baldwin II., who came to
ask Christian aid against the Infidel, and escorted by
Charles of Anjou, whose sense of the honour due to the
pontiff, so he said, forbade leaving him alone in Florence.
And as the Pope found the city to his liking, he decided
to spend the whole summer there. The 2nd of July was
the day fixed for the solemn reconciliation of the Guelphs
and Ghibellines, and the syndics, or leaders, of either
party were gathered in the town. On the waste of dry
sand in the bed of the Arno by the Ponte alle Grazie
wooden platforms had been erected, and here the Pope,
the Emperor Baldwin, and Charles of Anjou were seated
in state. The oath of peace was sworn in the presence of
a great throng of spectators; the syndics exchanged
kisses, and the Pope gave his benediction, threatening
excommunication on all who should dare to break the
peace. Both sides gave hostages and yielded castles as
pledges of faith, and everything seemed to be arranged in
accordance with the benevolent intentions of the Pope.
The Holy Father was lodged in the palace of his bankers,
the Mozzi, Baldwin in that of the bishop, while Charles
occupied several houses in the Frescobaldi gardens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
There was now time to enjoy life in Florence before the
return of the banished Ghibellines and the festivals to be
given in their honour. But suddenly it was learnt that
the Ghibelline syndics, instead of carrying out the concluding
terms of the peace, had hastily fled from Florence.
And the reason alleged for this was, that the king's
vicar had sent them an intimation that unless they left
the city without delay, he would have them all cut to
pieces at the request of the Guelph nobles. Thereupon
the Pope instantly set out for the Mugello, much enraged
not only with the king, but even more with the
Florentines for their indifference to the whole farce, and
he punished their violation of the oath by pronouncing an
interdict on the city.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charles continued his aggressive policy with
regard to the Ghibellines, and was seconded by the Florentines,
who marched out under the banner of the Commune,
sometimes alone, but oftener in junction with the French
cavalry, to impose peace and assure the triumph of their
party in all the neighbouring towns. But their arrogant
daring was sometimes pushed too far. When the Ghibellines
were expelled from Bölogna, the Florentines immediately
set out to proffer their unrequested aid to that
city. But, much to their amazement, on reaching the
banks of the Reno, they found the Bölognese waiting to
drive them back. The latter had achieved their purpose
of banishing the Ghibellines, but had no intention of
allowing the haughty Florentines to come to disseminate
their own party rancours under pretence of assisting the
city. The Podestà of the Florentines was killed in trying
to push through the opposing force, and the humiliated
expedition had to retrace its steps (1274).</p>

<p>They were more fortunate with regard to Pisa. That
city, being torn by party strife, had banished Giovanni
Visconti, judge of Gallura, and Count Ugolino della<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Gherardesca di Donoratico, two ambitious Ghibelline
nobles, who, deserting their own for the Guelph cause,
applied to the Florentines for help. They immediately
granted it, and joining forces with their new friends and
the French, invaded the territories of their old rival,
capturing the Castle of Asciano in September, 1275. The
following June, at the instigation of the same exiled
nobles, they resumed hostilities with a larger army, aided
by the Lucchese and other Guelphs, and accompanied by
the king's marshal. Again victorious, they compelled Pisa
to make peace on June 13, 1276, and recall her exiles,
especially the Count Ugolino, whose ambition was
destined to bring fatal consequences on himself and his
native town.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pope Gregory had returned from Lyons
and reached Tuscany in December, 1275. Still highly
irritated against Florence, he refused to enter its gates;
but as the Arno was too swollen to be fordable, he was
obliged to cross one of its bridges, and therefore raised
the interdict from the city, although only during the time
required for his passage. His death took place shortly
afterwards, January 10, 1276, and in a single year three
new Popes rapidly succeeded him: Innocent V., Adrian V.,
and John XXI. Then, on November 25, 1277, Nicholas
III. was elected to the pontifical Chair, and during his
three years' reign followed the same policy pursued by
Gregory X., and with even greater zeal. Full of
haughtiness and ambition, Nicholas sought to aggrandise
his own family as well as the Papal power. He renewed
the scandalous practice of nepotism and simony by making
some of his kinsmen cardinals and appointing others to
high offices of the State. But on trying to negotiate the
marriage of one of his nieces with a nephew of King
Charles, the latter mortally wounded his pride by the
reply, that although the Pope had crimson hose, his blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
had not been sufficiently ennobled to be mixed with that
of French <span class="locked">royalty.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span> Nicholas III., already disgusted with
the king, and suspicious of his motives, could not easily
pardon this affront. Hence he seized the first opportunity
to let Charles know that although Rudolf of Hapsburg
had not yet been crowned emperor in Rome, he had been
already elected king of the Romans in Germany, and that
accordingly it was no longer needful for Charles to fill the
post of vicar-imperial, only granted him during the
interregnum. Thus the French monarch was finally compelled
to resign the vicariate of Tuscany, the title of Roman
Senator, and even his jurisdiction over Romagna and the
Marches, that had been partly accorded to, partly usurped
by him. Perceiving that there was no possibility of
evading this blow, the king instantly yielded the point
without showing the slightest resentment, so that the
Pope was driven to declare: "This prince may have inherited
his fortune from the House of France, his cunning
from Spain, but his shrewdness of address could only
have been acquired by frequenting the Court of <span class="locked">Rome."<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span>
Nevertheless, he was not in the least deceived by the
king's apparent calmness, and neglected no chance of
diminishing his power and aggrandising that of the Holy
See. Thus, when Giovanni da Procida was going
through Italy seeking help for the Sicilian revolution
that was soon to burst forth, he received encouragement
from the Pope. Then, after showing much favour to
Rudolph of Hapsburg, Nicholas profited by the occasion
to obtain his sanction for extending the states of the
Church as far as the Neapolitan frontier on one side, and
for including the March of Ancona, Romagna and the
Pentapolis on the other. And down to our own day
the states of the Church preserved these boundaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
almost unaltered. Although at the time, the domination
of the Popes was chiefly nominal over part of this
territory, yet by dint of insistence they gradually achieved
practical supremacy over the whole of it.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>As a first step in this direction, Nicholas III. sent his
nephew, Cardinal Latino de' Frangipani, to establish peace
in Romagna. As a Dominican monk, Frangipani had
shown great powers of oratory, and was therefore fitted
to enforce the new authority of the Church. Count
Bertoldo Orsini was also sent with him. After a short
stay in Romagna, the cardinal was transferred to Florence
to renew with better success the reconciliation of hostile
parties Gregory X. had failed to conclude. Now, however,
the Florentines themselves seemed really desirous of
peace. Although freed from the too oppressive protection
of King Charles, they still suffered from the evil results of
his policy. The <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>, turbulent as ever, and with increased
numbers and strength, were threatening division even
among the Guelphs. Villani says of them that, "Resting
from victories and honours won in wars abroad, and
fattening on the lands of exiled Ghibellines and other
fruits of enterprise, they began from pride and envy to
fall out with one another; so that many quarrels and
feuds arose among the citizens of Florence, and much
killing and <span class="locked">wounding."<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></span> First the Adimari began to stir
riots from hatred against the Tosinghi, next the Pazzi
and Donati came to blows; and this was seen to be a
prelude to greater evils. Accordingly the Guelphs sent
messengers to the Pope, praying him to send some one
to pacify the city, unless he wished to see the party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
divided against itself. The Ghibellines seemed equally
anxious for peace. They were weary of prolonged exile
and continual confiscation of their property, and cherished
hopes that the popular hatred, being now inflamed against
the Guelph nobles, would be softened towards <span class="locked">themselves.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly Cardinal Latino entered Florence on
October 8, 1279, with three hundred knights and prelates
in his train, and was received with every token of honour.
The Florentine clergy went to meet him in procession,
and the Republic sent forth the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Carroccio</span></i> with a great
number of standard-bearers. Being a Dominican, he was
lodged in the monastery of Santa Maria Novella, and laid
the first stone of the celebrated church of that name.
He immediately began the negotiations for the arrangement
of peace.</p>

<p>On the 19th of November platforms were raised in the
Piazza of Santa Maria Novella Vecchia, and the parliament
being assembled there in the presence of the magistrates
and councils, the cardinal asked and obtained the power
of concluding peace with the same authority possessed by
the people&mdash;that is to say, the right of imposing fines,
decreeing confiscations, and occupying castles, to guarantee
the due performance of the terms about to be sworn.
He next essayed to reconcile the bitterest foes: Guelphs
who had come to a rupture, quarrelsome Ghibellines, and
hostile Guelphs and Ghibellines. All went well until he
came to the Buondelmonti and Uberti, whose ancient hatred
was too deeply rooted. It was impossible to persuade them
to be reconciled, for some of them indignantly rejected
the proposal. Hence the Cardinal had to decree their
excommunication, and banish the more obstinate from the
Commune. Finally, January 18, 1280, was fixed for the
conclusion of the general peace. Great preparations for
the ceremony were made in the Piazza of Santa Maria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Novella Vecchia; the platforms were hung with tapestries,
and the whole square carpeted with cloth. Hither came
the Twelve, the Podestà, the Captain of the people (then
styled Captain of the mass of the Guelph party), and their
councils, together with all the rest of the magistrates, and
a great concourse of spectators. Lastly came the cardinal
with his attendant prelates, and the general excitement was
heightened by the expectation of his speech, since he was
known to be one of the most eloquent orators of his time.
He gave an address on the merit and necessity of making
peace, and finally the treaty was read aloud. It was to
put an end to all the old hatreds; it stipulated the restitution
of confiscated property to the Ghibellines, with some
interest on the capital; all sentences, oaths, leagues, and
associations made by the one party to the hurt of the other
were declared null and void, and every clause of the
statutes tending to the perpetuation of strife was to be
cancelled. Either party was to furnish fifty sureties, and
bound to forfeit the sum of fifty thousand silver marks,
in case of any violation of the peace. As an additional
guarantee certain castles were to be given up, and the right
was reserved of demanding more hostages should occasion
require. Then came a long string of minute stipulations,
all directed to the same end. Many of the chief families
were to be confined to fixed places until they made peace
with their foes and gave money and hostages in pledge of
good faith. The delegates of both parties kissed one
another on the mouth, the documents of the treaty were
solemnly registered, and party decrees of banishment and
other sentences cancelled or burnt. The exiles were
authorised to return; and, without prejudice to the functions
of the Podestà, the captains, and guild-masters,
were charged with the strict maintenance of the terms of
peace. For this reason the Captain was no longer to
be entitled Captain of the Guelph party, but Captain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
the city and conservator of peace. Also, the office of
vicar-imperial granted to Charles having now lapsed, it
was decreed that henceforward the Podestà and Captain
were to be nominated for two years by the Pope, and have
each the command of fifty horse and fifty foot soldiers.
After two years the right of election would be resumed
by the people, provided their nominees were not opposed
to, but actually approved by, the Head of the Church.
Each Captain would then have the command of one
hundred horse and one hundred foot, but, for the better
preservation of peace, the said troops must neither be
citizens nor natives of the territory. The guilds were
likewise sworn to assist in maintaining peace. It was
farther decreed that the statutes should be revised, the
government of the city reformed, and an estimate made
of the property of all persons who had been condemned
to pay fines or <span class="locked">damages.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></span></p>

<p>This would seem to show that the cardinal was almost
in the position of a provisional dictator, with arbitrary
power of decision. But he first consulted the magistrates
as to many clauses proposed by him, while regarding other
conditions of the agreement the Florentines obeyed them
or not as they chose. The people desired peace for the
reasons we have already described and the cardinal was
therefore given full powers to conclude it on his own
authority and that of the Church. But his success was far
more apparent than real. In fact, the constitution of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Guelph party remained in force, and as soon as he had
gone, the city was again torn by faction strife. He left
Florence on April 24, 1280, after receiving a recompense
of "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mille floreni auri in pecunia numerata, et alie zoie
empte pro Comuni Florentie.</span>"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, during February and the beginning of
March, he was so satisfied with his imagined success as to
attempt the reconciliation of many adversaries confined to
fixed domiciles. He likewise tried to give effect to the
constitutional reforms prescribed by the peace; above
all, that of replacing the twelve worthies by fourteen
"good men," composed of eight Guelphs and six Ghibellines.
These functionaries, in co-operation with the
Captains and the councils, formed the government of the
city, and were changed every second month. Nevertheless,
the Podestà and Captain remained in office for one
year more. The authority of the Podestà, as the nominee
of King Charles, had been much diminished under the
latter's rule; accordingly increased powers were now
conferred on the Captain and Twelve, and the latter
being augmented to <span class="locked">fourteen,<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></span> constituted the supreme
power or Signory of Florence.</p>

<p>This custom of changing the Signory every second
month&mdash;a custom maintained to the close of the Republic&mdash;has
given rise to much discussion. Certainly, this rapid
mutation of the highest power in the State could not
be favourable to peace; but, as we have had frequent
occasion to note, the new constitution of the guilds had
reduced the attributes of the central government to a
minimum. Besides, the manifest tendency of all Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
republics to degenerate into despotism made the Florentines
distrustful of any Signory of longer duration. Now,
too, the Ghibellines having returned, there was special
cause to fear that the government might be induced to
conspire in favour of some ambitious personage disposed
to play the tyrant at a moment's notice. For these
reasons, it was decided on the one hand to lessen the
authority of the Podestà, and on the other to frequently
change not only the heads of the government but even,
as will be seen, other political functionaries as well.
Later on, election by ballot was adopted as another
means of preventing the carrying out of any prearranged
design against <span class="locked">freedom.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></span></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the King of the Romans was sending his
vicar to Italy, with an escort of three hundred men only, to
ascertain the temper of the land, and whether the cities still
acknowledged the suzerainty of the Empire. On arriving
in Tuscany, the vicar made halt at San Miniato al Tedesco,
and found the Pisans still Ghibellines, and eager to swear
fealty. But when the other Tuscan cities refused to recognise
the rights of the Empire the Florentines corrupted
the vicar with bribes, and, showing him the futility of
his mission, persuaded him to depart acknowledging the
force of the privileges granted them by the Pope.</p>

<p>Thus they dexterously contrived to make the altered
policy of Rome a means of advancing their own interests
and damaging those of King Charles, whose power over
Central Italy was entirely lost. By once more calling
the Empire to the front, and encouraging Rudolph of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
Hapsburg to assert himself against Charles, Nicholas III.
succeeded in weakening both, while giving new strength
to the Papacy. So, too, with equal sagacity, the Florentines
had made use of the king to dominate Tuscany; of
the Pope to enfeeble the king; and, finally, of both to
avoid yielding submission to Rudolph.</p>

<p>Nicholas III. died in 1280. He had compelled Charles
to leave Tuscany, and be satisfied with receiving from
Rudolph the investiture of Provence and the kingdom of
Naples. To render this agreement more binding, by
means of a family alliance, Rudolph gave his daughter
in marriage to a grandson of King Charles. But naturally
the latter accepted the arrangement most reluctantly, and
took every opportunity of secretly exciting the Tuscan
Guelphs against the Ghibellines, who were again coming
to the front. Also, having learnt by his own experience
the serious difference between having the Popes as friends
or as foes, he hastened to Orvieto, where the new conclave
was sitting, determined to use every means to procure the
election of some candidate favouring his views. As usual,
he pursued this purpose unhesitatingly and without scruple.
Perceiving that the cardinals were temporising, and
dreading the consequences of delay, he excited a revolt,
during which the populace captured two cardinals of the
Orsini house, relations of the deceased Pope, and decidedly
opposed to the Angevin interests. After this event the
election took place, and on February 22, 1281, Martin IV.
was proclaimed. The new pontiff was French, and being
very friendly to Charles, immediately undertook to forward
his policy and support the Guelphs.</p>

<p>But the general conditions of Italy were much changed,
and therefore the king's triumph at Orvieto failed to prevent
the consequences entailed by his cruelty in Naples,
and by the policy of Nicholas III. from producing their
natural effect. The latter's agreement with Rudolph was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
ratified by the new Pope, who counselled the cities of Italy
to accord a hearty welcome to the emperor's daughter,
when she came as the bride of the king's nephew. Even
Florence was obliged to give the princess an honourable
reception, although she was accompanied by an Imperial
vicar, who, as usual, abode at San Miniato, in order to
attempt to resuscitate the rights of the Empire in Tuscany.
But a far graver change occurred in March, 1282, when
the Sicilians, wearied of misgovernment, at last snatched
up the gauntlet thrown by Conradin to the people, and
with the sanguinary revolt of the Vespers began the long
and glorious war that was to free Sicily for ever from the
Angevin yoke. In order to keep faith with the Guelph
party and avoid unnecessarily irritating the Pope or the
king, the Florentines sent five hundred horse to the latter's
aid; and this contingent, commanded by Count Guido di
Battifolle of the Guidi house, and bearing the banner of
Florence, took part in the siege of Messina. But the
revolution was everywhere triumphant; the Florentines
shared in the general defeat, and had to return, leaving
their flag in the enemy's hands. The island was inevitably
lost to the French.</p>

<p>Even before the outbreak of the Sicilian Vespers the
Florentines had naturally begun to be on the alert and
watchful of their own interests. Noting that the vicar
was only attended by a small force, and gained few
adherents, they soon tried to win him with gold, and
succeeded in persuading him to leave the country after
confirming the concessions previously granted to them.
At the same time, profiting by the emperor's weakness in
consequence of troubles at home, and by the fact of
Charles being at a distance in Naples and already gravely
preoccupied concerning the approaching crisis in Sicily,
they seized the opportunity to make some constitutional
reforms. First of all, now that the Podestà and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
were no longer elected by the king, but named instead by
the Pope, they decided to grant them ampler powers, in
order to keep the city quiet by checking the arrogance of
the Ghibellines and tyranny of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>. Both factions
were daily becoming more threatening; and particularly
the latter, which cancelled magisterial decrees by absolute
force, prevented the laws from being executed, committed
murder either directly or indirectly for the sake of party
revenge, and kept the city in a perpetual turmoil. It was
therefore decreed to allow the Podestà greater freedom of
action in the general repression of crime, and give the
Captain a larger force with which to maintain order and
punish criminals to whom the Podestà might have been
too lenient. The <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i> were not only bound to swear
obedience to the laws, but to give hostages for their good
faith; so that even should they succeed in escaping from
the city after committing any crime, those who had given
surety, or stood hostage for them, would have to suffer in
their stead all punishments or fines to which the contumacious
were condemned. To ensure the execution of all
these decrees a thousand armed men were chosen among
the citizens. Of this number two hundred were contributed
by the Sesto of St. Piero Scheraggio, as many by
that of the Borgo, the four other Sesti each giving 150
men, and then the whole thousand being divided in companies
with the banners of the different quarters, or rather
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestieri</span></i> of the city, 450 men were placed at the orders
of the Podestà, and 550 under the Captain's command.
They bore colours given them by either magistrate in the
presence of the public parliament, and whenever the bell
rang the signal for their assembly no gatherings of the
people were allowed in the <span class="locked">city.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
This reform seemed the more indispensable, seeing that
under Charles's rule the employment of citizen soldiers
commanded by the gonfaloniers of the guilds had fallen
into disuse, and order was maintained by means of foreign
troops. Thus the Captain had forfeited much of the
authority that it was now sought to restore to him.
Now, too, we find the Fourteen empowered to conduct
the government without summoning the Council of One
Hundred, of which the documents cease to make mention.
Owing to this, and also to the lack of concord between
the eight Guelph and six Ghibelline members, the authority
of the Fourteen, instead of being strengthened, suffered
decline. Accordingly, another reform was in course of
arrangement, when the outbreak of the Sicilian Vespers
gave the Florentines more freedom of action. They had
three special objects in view. Firstly, to make the
Republic independent of Pope, emperor and king;
secondly, to close accounts with the Ghibellines, because
they were nobles, and as constant adherents to the Empire
supported its pretensions in Tuscany; thirdly, to lower
the pride of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>, whether Guelphs or Ghibellines,
because their tyrannous deeds kept the city in continual
disturbance. This, indeed, was one reason why the terms
of Cardinal Latino's peace were no longer observed; and
why, above all, the promised indemnities to injured
Ghibellines had never been paid. Also, on February 8,
1282, a Guelphic League was concluded with Lucca,
Pistoia, Prato, Volterra, and Sienna, whose adherence was
compulsory; and San Gimignano, Colle, and Poggibonsi
were also given permission to join. The members of the
League swore to remain united ten years for the common
defence, and were each pledged to hire five hundred horse
with the customary number of squires. Also, as usual,
the allies joined in a species of convention touching the
exchange and passage of merchandise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
But the most important point for Florence was the
internal reform of the city. All the guilds, and especially
some of greater, were becoming more strongly organised,
and acquiring increased political influence. In fact, the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">capitudini</span></i>, or guild-masters, figure more frequently in the
public records, side by side with the Fourteen, the Captain,
and Podestà. It is at this period (1282&ndash;3) that we even
find mentioned a <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Defensor Artificum et Artium</span></i>, together
with two councils, an indubitable sign of the growing
power of the <span class="locked">guilds.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></span> For, although the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Defensor</span></i> disappears
later on, and his office is deputed to the Captain,
this change only occurred when the government of the
Republic was actually carried on by the guilds. Meanwhile
they already shared in the election of the Fourteen,
and aided them with their advice. The chroniclers tell
us that by a reform enacted in June, 1282, the priors of
the guilds were finally raised to office in place of the
Fourteen; but in fact the change happened less suddenly
than might be inferred from their account of the matter.
For we find that&mdash;as was always the case with Florentine
reforms&mdash;the Fourteen continued to govern in co-operation
with the new priors, until, overshadowed by the growing
importance of the latter, they gradually disappeared
altogether. It is certain that on June 15, 1282, three
<i>Priors of the Arts</i> were made chiefs of the Republic&mdash;namely,
the priors of the Calimala, Money Changers, and
Woollen Guilds. They were attended by six guards
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">berrovieri</span></i>), and had six heralds to summon the citizens
to council; they dwelt in the Badia, without leaving it
during their whole term of office, and generally deliberated
in junction with the captain. The Fourteen remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
office with them for some time longer, but chiefly <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro
forma</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> After the first two months it was deemed
necessary to increase the number of the priors, not only
because three were found to be insufficient; but also being
necessarily chosen from one or the other half of the six
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestieri</span></i>, they invariably seemed to represent one division
only of the citizens. Accordingly, to avoid delay,
in the August of the same year, the three guilds of
Doctors and Druggists, Silkweavers and Mercers, Skinners
and Furriers, were added to the original number. Other
guilds also were subsequently added, but the number of
the priors remained restricted to six, one for each <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestiere</span></i>.
Compagni says that "their laws [or functions] consisted
in guarding the property of the Commune, and in seeing
that the signories did justice to every one, and that petty
and feeble folk were not oppressed by the great and
<span class="locked">powerful."<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></span> At the end of their two months' term the
priors, assisted by the guild-masters and a few additional
citizens, designated as <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">arroti</span></i>, elected their own successors
to office.</p>

<p>Villani affirms that the title of prior was derived from
a verse of the Gospel, where Christ says to His disciples,
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vos estis priores.</span>" What is certain is that by means of
this reform the guilds, or rather commerce and trade, had
the whole government of the Republic in their hands;
and it should also be noted that although the above-mentioned
guilds, together with that of the jurists and
notaries, constituted the seven greater arts, yet the legal
guild&mdash;perhaps because it represented neither industry
nor commerce&mdash;is left unnoticed by the chroniclers at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
this point. Henceforward the Commonwealth is a true
republic of traders, and only to be governed by members
of the guilds. Every title of nobility, whether old or
new, becomes an impediment rather than a privilege.</p>

<p>Consequently many of the principal families began to
change their names in order to disguise their former rank.
The Tornaquinci divided into Popoleschi, Tornabuoni,
Giachinotti, &amp;c.; the Cavalcanti became Malatesti and
Ciampoli; and others assumed fresh <span class="locked">names.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></span> Nevertheless,
many proudly clung to their ancient appellations and titles;
and when King Charles' son, the Prince of Salerno, was
summoned to Naples from Provence, he halted in Florence
by the way on purpose to imitate his father by creating
new knights. By these artificial devices it was hoped to
give new strength to an aristocracy that was doomed to
decline by the natural course of events; but the means
employed were too utterly opposed to the political and
social temper of Florence to have the slightest success
there. No longer fettered by Pope and emperor, and
emancipated from the oppressive patronage of King
Charles, who was now absorbed in Sicilian matters, the
Florentines had organised the constitution in the manner
that suited them best, and by entrusting the greater
guilds with the management of the State gained a real
predominance in Tuscany that they turned most skilfully
to account for the extension of their trade. The politico-commercial
league, concluded in March, 1282, to which
we have already alluded, proved most beneficial to their
interests, and the subjection of neighbouring towns and
territories was another means to the same end.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the two Ghibelline cities of Arezzo and
Pisa still remained hostile to Florence. The former was
a threatening presence in the upper Val d'Arno, while
the latter, with its wealth, power, and command of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
sea, was a danger to the lower valley, and, standing on
the road to Leghorn and Porto Pisano, was an obstruction
to the maritime trade of Florence. Hence it was obvious
that sooner or later the Republic would be forced to
combine with friendly neighbours and new allies against
both these foes, and especially against Pisa. Free access
to the sea-board was more indispensable than ever to
the Florentine trade, and should Pisa continue to block
the way, the Republic would reap nothing from the
successes it had already achieved.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Florentines enjoyed the benefits of
peace for two quiet years. During this time Charles'
son, the Prince of Salerno, and other members of the
royal house were received in the city with all due pomp
and parade. In March, 1283, the king came in person
to Florence on his way to Bordeaux, where he was to
engage in single combat with Peter of Aragon, who had
been proclaimed Lord of Sicily by the people of the
island. By this much-talked-of duel, that never took
place, the war desolating Southern Italy was to be brought
to an end. Even on this occasion the king, although
noisily welcomed in Florence, and probably oppressed by
grave anxiety, insisted on creating more knights, regardless
of the trouble he caused to the people. Nevertheless,
after he had gone, the merrymakings were continued with
greater zest than before. On St. John's Day, always a
great festival in Florence, a company was formed of a
thousand young men, who, clothed in white robes and led
by one of their number representing the "Lord of <span class="locked">Love,"<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></span>
inaugurated games and diversions of every kind, giving
dances in the streets and within doors to persons of all
ranks&mdash;ladies, knights, and common folk. This Court of
Love was in imitation of certain French customs first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
introduced into Florence by the Angevins. It now
numbered three hundred knights, so-called <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">di corredo</span></i>,
chiefly created by King Charles, according to the French
mode. They gave banquets and had a train of pages,
courtiers, and buffoons imported from various parts of
Italy and France. But all this was a fruitless attempt
to introduce customs opposed to the city's traditions, a
childish means of asserting the existence of a new patrician
order. The populace was enchanted with these gay
doings; but the thriftier citizens at the head of the
government, and constituting the real strength of the
Republic, highly disapproved of them, and were disgusted
to find that after struggling so long to repress
the nobility fresh efforts were needed to stamp out its
remains. Throughout Tuscany, indeed, fresh warfare
was impending, for the Sicilian Vespers seemed to have
roused the Imperialists to new vigour. For this reason
Corso Donati had declared, at a <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">consulta</span></i> held on February
26, 1285, that all districts appertaining to the Empire
(<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">de Imperio</span></i>) and bordering the Florentine territory were
to be subject <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad iurisdictionem Comunis Florentiae</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> New
agreements were made to this effect with the other
Guelph <span class="locked">cities.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></span> But the most urgent consideration of all
was how to overcome the pride and power of Pisa, that
obstinately Ghibelline city with whom Florence had
always been compelled to struggle, and must now struggle
anew. But how was success to be assured? Florence
was neither willing nor able to depend on the help of the
French king, and even with the combined aid of all
its allies could not muster sufficient strength for the
enterprise. Therefore much sagacity and diplomatic
skill were required in order to multiply the resources<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
of the Republic, and the Florentines proved equal to
the occasion.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Although the city of Pisa derived all its strength and
influence from its maritime trade, nevertheless&mdash;either
from being always on the Imperial side, or because such
was the predestined fate of all Italian sea-board republics&mdash;it
was dominated by a powerful aristocracy to the same
extent as were Genoa and Venice. With their usual
astuteness, the Florentines had long sought to bring their
influence to bear on the Pisan nobles, in order to create
discord among them. Giovanni Visconti, entitled Judge
of Gallura, from the high and remunerative post once
held by him in Sardinia, as governor of several provinces,
for the Pisan Republic, had been subsequently (1274)
exiled on account of his Guelph proclivities, and had
then joined the vicar of King Charles and the Guelph
League against his native state. He died in 1275; and
just at that time Count Ugolino della Gherardesca, one
of the most powerful and ambitious nobles of Pisa, who
aspired to establish a despotism there, was driven into
banishment with other formidable Guelphs (1275).
These exiles not only made alliance with the Florentines,
but, in conjunction with the League, or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Taglia</span></i>, made war
on Pisa and captured several castles, Vico Pisano included.
In the September of the same year they returned to the
attack in co-operation with the Angevin vicar-royal,
Florentines, and Lucchese, and, defeating their fellow-citizens
at three miles' distance from Pisa, seized
the Castle of Asciano, which was handed over to the
Lucchese. In 1276 the war was resumed by Florence
and Lucca, and again at the instigation of Count Ugolino
and his friends. This was the occasion alluded to at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
earlier page, when both sides brought powerful armies
into the field and came to a pitched battle between Pisa
and Pontedera, on the banks of the so-called Fosso
Arnonico, a canal into which the Pisans had formerly
diverted the waters of the Arno for the better defence
of their territory. Again the Pisans were worsted, and
the bitterness of defeat enhanced by having to accept
peace on the terms proposed by Florence, of which the
first and hardest condition was the readmittance in their
city of all the banished Guelphs, and particularly of the
ambitious Count Ugolino, whom they hated so deeply.</p>

<p>Pope Gregory X. was highly displeased by this war,
and by the ardour and pertinacity with which it was pursued,
for he considered the Ghibelline spirit of Pisa a barrier
to the growing power of the Florentines, who, in spite of
being Guelphs, used every effort to become wholly independent
of the Papacy. Wherefore, after vainly enjoining
them to put an end to the war, he excommunicated their
city. But the Florentines offered slight excuses, and until
1276 paid no attention to his thunders. Then at last
peace was declared, but during its very brief duration
plans were arranged for new expeditions.</p>

<p>After this the Republic of Pisa enjoyed a few tranquil
years, and owing to the vastness of its trade and the
extension of its colonies, its finances were rapidly restored
to their former prosperity. Unfortunately, certain Pisan
families had become so powerful by means of their wealth
that, no longer satisfied with republican equality, they
sought to dominate the internal affairs of the State and
direct its foreign policy in favour of their personal ambition
rather than of the interests of the State. The Judges
of Gallura and Arborea, Counts Ugolino, Fazio, Neri,
and Anselmo della Gherardesca, all had their own little
courts and men-at-arms after the fashion of princes.
Absorbed in covetous rivalries, they distracted the attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
of the magistrates from the dangers threatening their
republic, and daily becoming graver and more imminent.
For, in fact, the strength of the Republic was not only
almost exhausted by the continuous attacks of the
Guelph League, but for some time past the rivalry of
Genoa had been threatening to culminate in a still deadlier
strife. As both these maritime cities were Ghibelline,
they had every reason to be at peace with each other and
combine in defending their interests against the far greater
sea power of Venice. But, on the contrary, this only
seemed to exasperate their reciprocal jealousy. Their
fleets were constantly in collision in Levantine waters.
They had a desperate encounter in 1277 near Constantinople
and on the Black Sea. It ended in disaster for the
Pisans, who had been the assailants, and from that moment
they panted for revenge. Nor were opportunities lacking.
While the Venetians were asserting absolute dominion
over the Adriatic, the Genoese and Pisans, hard by on the
Mediterranean, were always crossing each other's tracks,
inasmuch as both were engaged in the same trading
ventures, and both possessed colonies in the same islands
of Corsica and Sardinia. Thus, they were involved in continual
conflict. Then, too, as the Guelph League was
specially hostile to Pisa, it supplied Genoa with perpetual
pretexts for beginning the hostilities which the Florentines
were seeking to incite by every political manœuvre. At
last their reciprocal hatred reached so high a pitch that
the Pisans themselves were the first to provoke the war.
Their burning desire for reprisals was continually kept
aflame by the greed of the nobles, who hoped to convert
the conflict into a ladder to power, and whose own
ambitions were spurred by the crafty encouragement of
Florence.</p>

<p>Corsica was ruled by a certain Sinucello, bearing the
title of Judge of Cinarca. He had been educated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Pisa, and the Republic had assisted him to regain and
increase his hereditary possessions in the island. Governing
there as a vassal of Pisa, he nevertheless transferred
his allegiance to the Genoese, who occupied another part of
the island. Later on, after perpetrating every species of
cruel and tyrannous deeds, he turned against the Genoese
and devastated their Corsican towns. Taking refuge at
Pisa, that republic granted him protection as a former vassal,
equally regardless of the subsequent treaties, by which
he had sworn fealty to Genoa, and of all the barbarities
he had committed. Pisa tried to reinstate Sinucello in
Corsica by force, but as the Genoese were determined to
keep him at a distance, this served to provoke hostilities.
In fact, being sent back to the island with 120 horse and
200 foot, he was able to recapture his possessions; but
from that moment (1282) the Genoese and Pisan ships
were always chasing one another over the Mediterranean
in order to engage. Accordingly, from the end of 1282
to the August of 1283, a continual series of sanguinary
conflicts took place, sometimes attaining the proportions
of real naval battles; and although the Pisans were
generally defeated, they always rallied their forces, and
prepared to resume the struggle. On one occasion half
their fleet perished in a storm; nevertheless, shortly after
this (1284) they sent twenty-four galleys to escort Count
Fazio to Sardinia, where collisions with the Genoese
were of constant occurrence. In fact, on the 1st of May,
they encountered the latter's fleet, gave battle, and carried
on an obstinate fight that lasted the whole day. Finally,
however, the Pisans were beaten off, leaving thirteen
galleys and a great number of prisoners in the enemy's
hands. Notwithstanding this reverse, the same year witnessed
another naval battle between the two republics,
that proved one of the most memorable fights on record
in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Genoa, whose victories had cost her dear, caused vessels
to be built and equipped in every port of the Riviera;
while Pisa, although exhausted by so many conflicts on
sea and land, made prodigious efforts of all kinds. By
appealing to the patriotism of her noblest families, she
elicited a worthy response. The Lanfranchi, a numerous
Pisan clan, equipped no less than eleven galleys at their
own expense; the Gualandi, Lei, and Gaetani, furnished
six; the Sismondi three; the Orlandi four; the Upezzinghi
five; the Visconti three; the Moschi two; and
other families joined in equipping one. Andrea Morosini,
the Venetian, one of the highest naval celebrities of
the time, was chosen Podestà, with full powers to make all
requisite preparations for the war, and to then assume the
chief command of the fleet at sea. Thus both sides sent
forth the most formidable armaments to be seen in those
times. Genoese writers reckon their vessels to have been
ninety-six in number, and those of Pisa seventy-two;
whereas Pisan historians reckon their fleet at 103 sail
against 130 of the Genoese. At any rate, both are agreed
that the Genoese fleet outnumbered the Pisan, and that its
superiority was enhanced by the greater skill of its commanders.
The two armadas cruised in search of each
other for some time, and then tacked about before giving
battle, each trying to gain the better position. It is
averred that the Pisans sailed to the entrance of the port
of Genoa, discharging silver arrows and balls covered with
purple cloth, in order to make a display of wealth, after
the usage of the time. Anyhow, it is known that some
of their galleys were anchored off Porto Pisano, and others
lying in the Arno, between the two bridges of the city,
when the news came that the Genoese fleet had been sighted.
All Pisa was in a turmoil; scattered crews hastened on
board, and the archbishop, attended by his clergy, and
bearing the banner of the Republic, appeared on the Ponte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Vecchio, and blessed the fleet. Thereupon, amid joyful
shouts, the galleys weighed anchor, and swept down the
river to the sea. It is related that at the moment the
benediction was pronounced the crucifix on the standard
fell down, which was judged a bad omen.</p>

<p>The 6th of August, 1284, was a memorable day. The
two fleets met off Meloria, at a short distance from Porto
Pisano. Here in past times the Genoese had been
severely defeated by the Pisans, and here they now sought
revenge in the famous battle so fully recorded by our
historians. The remoteness of the event, and the discrepancies
between Tuscan and Genoese accounts, make it
very difficult to obtain absolute knowledge of all the
details of this fight. Accordingly it will be safer to fix
our attention on the best ascertained and more remarkable
points.</p>

<p>The Pisan fleet consisted of three squadrons. Of
these, Admiral Andrea Morosini commanded the first;
while the second was under Count Ugolino, who, in spite
of his courage, was no trustworthy leader, on account of
the devouring personal ambition urging him to subordinate
the interests of the State to his own greed for power.
The third was commanded by Andreotto Saracini. Oberto
Doria, an officer of great courage and experience, was
high admiral of the Genoese fleet. As it first hove in
sight, this armada seemed no greater than that of the
Pisans, but only because a reserve of thirty galleys, commanded
by Benedetto Zaccaria, lay hidden behind Meloria&mdash;or,
according to other accounts, behind Montenero&mdash;ready
to join in the fight when required. Soon after
midday the battle began, and raged for some hours
without any decisive result. But when the two flag-ships
met, both fleets closed in a general engagement. On either
side vast numbers of combatants, killed, wounded, or
stunned, were hurled into the sea. The waves were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
crimsoned with blood; drowning men clutched at oars
to save their lives, but were relentlessly thrust under by
the rowers' next strokes, owing to the impossibility of
checking the manœuvres in the thick of the fight, and at
the most critical moment. Just then Benedetto Zaccaria,
having been signalled for, hove in sight, full sail, and
with sweeping oars, in time to decide the fate of the day.
Seeing him draw near, the Pisans knew they were outnumbered,
and their courage began to fail, although they
continued the fight with undiminished ardour. As Zaccaria
dashed in, he contrived to bring his galley alongside
Doria's, so as to wedge Morosini, whose flag-ship was
making a gallant defence. At the same time the galley
bearing the Pisan standard was also surrounded by the
foe. On all sides the sudden arrival of the reserve
squadron had given fresh courage to the Genoese and
diminished the hopes of Pisa. The struggle was now too
unequal; nevertheless, both sides were unwilling to end
it, for each bitter enemy was seeking to destroy not
only the other's fleet, but the very life of the rival
Republic.</p>

<p>But the conflict could not go on for ever. The Pisan
banner, on its tall iron shaft, was suddenly seen to bend,
and the next instant it fell with a horrible crash beneath a
storm of blows, while at the same moment the admiral's
flag-ship began to give way, and Morosini, who had been
shockingly wounded in the face, was forced to surrender.
At this juncture Count Ugolino, for his own treasonable
purposes, gave the signal for flight, and thus completed
the catastrophe. Seven Pisan galleys were sunk, twenty-eight
captured by the foe, while, according to the inscription
on the Church of St. Matteo at Genoa, no less than
9,272 prisoners were taken. Certain Pisan writers raise
the number to eleven, and some even to fifteen thousand;
but this may have included many of the slain, who may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
undoubtedly be reckoned at five thousand. At all events,
after the battle of Meloria, it became a common saying in
Tuscany that one must now go to Genoa in order to see
Pisa.</p>

<p>When those who had escaped returned to Pisa, all the
town flocked into the streets to ask news of their kindred,
and nearly all had to mourn the loss of some killed or
captured relations. A host of old men, women, and
children wandered about the city maddened with despair,
so that at last the magistrates were forced to ordain that
all should keep to their own homes. Soon all the
inhabitants were clad in black, and only women were seen
in the streets. Genoa, on the contrary, rejoiced and
made glad; but victory had no wise softened its hatred
against Pisa. This was proved when the fate of the
prisoners came to be discussed. Some citizens proposed
putting them to a heavy ransom; others to exchange
them for the Castel di Castro in Sardinia, the key of
the Pisan possessions there; but neither suggestion was
approved. Orators raised their voices, crying that it were
best to retain the prisoners until the war should be really
at an end. Thus the women, being practically widowed,
but unable to re-marry, population would be checked,
and the Pisan army prevented from repairing its losses.
In fact, the war continued sixteen years longer; and by the
time the prisoners were released, their number was reduced
to one thousand and odd, all the rest having succumbed
to disease, old age, injuries, or hardships.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>It is difficult to decide which rose to greater proportions
during these years&mdash;the heroic endurance of calamity on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
part of the Pisans, or the insatiable hatred of their victors.
Soon after the catastrophe of Meloria, Florence and Lucca
proposed an alliance with Genoa, in order to join that
power in completing the extermination of the rival
republic. This alliance was to be maintained for twenty-five
years from the conclusion of the war. Hostilities
were to commence within fifteen days, Genoa being
pledged to provide fifty galleys, and Florence and Lucca
to furnish an army. Thus the allies could make combined
attacks by sea and by land, and were bound to carry
on the campaign for at least forty days every year. Pisa
understood that her total overthrow was decreed, and her
detestation of Lucca, and still more of Florence, was so
keen that, to avoid yielding to those states, she professed
her readiness to accept instead the terms of submission
Genoa had sought to impose. But it was now too late.
On the 13th of October the treaty of alliance was subscribed,
in the Badia at Florence, by delegates from
Lucca and Genoa, together with the representatives of
Florence, of whom Brunetto Latini was one. An arrangement
was also made allowing the other Tuscan cities to
join the League, and, what was far more remarkable,
another clause provided for the admission of Pisan
prisoners of influential position who should have sworn to
make war on their own state. Even Count Ugolino, his
sons, and the Judge of Gallura, were to be admitted on
the same terms, provided they became Genoese citizens
and acknowledged the suzerainty of Genoa over their
estates. Nevertheless, no prisoners were to be admitted
without the general consent of the allies, and were not to
exceed twenty in number. This clause clearly proves that
many Pisans were traitorous, or disposed to treason. Nor
was Florence forgetful of the aim she had constantly in
view; for even on this occasion she took care to insert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
profitable commercial agreements in the treaty of political
<span class="locked">alliance.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></span></p>

<p>Several other cities of Tuscany speedily adhered to the
League, and preparations for war began. Pisa was soon
surrounded on all sides. The Florentines marched into
Val d'Era, the Lucchese captured several castles, while
Spinola's Genoese squadron attacked Porto Pisano and
wrought much damage there. Suddenly, however, the
Florentines showed so much slackness in lending their
aid, as to excite the grave discontent of Lucca and Genoa.
Their chief object was to promote their own commerce;
hence, while anxious to break Pisa's pride, and reduce the
city to submission on the plan pursued with other Tuscan
towns, it did not suit their views to let the Genoese usurp
the chief share of the work, much less the lion's share
of the profit. Yet, as things stood, the latter's naval
superiority rendered this result only too certain. For,
were Genoa once mistress of Pisa, the Mediterranean
would be practically hers, and, with so much increased
power, would be truly formidable to Florence.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after raising such a host of enemies against
Pisa, the Florentines now tried to turn things to their own
exclusive advantage, and, with the usual double dealing of
the period, paid little respect to the treaties they had sworn
to observe. The Pisans instantly saw their opportunity
and sought to profit by it; but in so bungling a fashion
as to hasten their ruin. As we have already related, they
had vainly attempted to come to terms with Genoa, and,
their grievous calamities rendering them unable to cope
with assailants equally formidable by land and by sea, they
now made endeavours to conciliate Florence. For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
purpose they nominated Count Ugolino to the office of
Podestà, and even entrusted him subsequently with the
direction of the war, in spite of the general belief that he
had played the traitor at Meloria. For, knowing him to
be Guelph, and secretly favourable to the Florentines, they
considered him fitted to fulfil their purpose of detaching the
latter from the Genoese interests. They knew, also, that
the count was absorbed in the single idea of establishing
his own domination in Pisa; therefore he would be ready
to come to terms, if required, with the enemies of his
country, and be capable of the worst crimes in order to
gratify his enormous ambition. But, this ambition once
sated, the Pisans believed that, possessing many friends
among the Guelphs, his courage and astuteness would enable
him to arrange satisfactory terms. This proved to be the
case, but his intervention led to very unexpected results.</p>

<p>The chroniclers relate that Ugolino sent the rectors of
Florence a present of Vernaccia wine, with gold florins at
the bottom of every flask as a <span class="locked">bribe.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></span> This legend merely
signifies that he was considered capable of employing any
means to attain his own ends. At all events, he was
obliged to impose very cruel sacrifices on Pisa before the
Florentines could be induced to suspend hostilities. It
was necessary to cede important domains, castles such as
Sta Maria a Monte, Fucecchio, Sta Croce, and Monte
Calvoli, and to restore the city to the Guelphs by banishing
all the Ghibellines&mdash;the direst humiliation to a republic
that had always been steadfastly Ghibelline. But, with
her very existence at stake, Pisa was bound to submit even
to this.</p>

<p>When, however, the Genoese and Lucchese discovered
that the Florentines had deserted them and were siding
with Pisa against Lucca, they complained so bitterly
of this breach of faith, that Count Ugolino deemed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
well to at least silence Lucca by the cession of Bientina,
Ripafratta, and Viareggio. In this manner the haughty
Pisan Republic was stripped of nearly all its territories
outside the city gates, and deprived of all power of
defending the coast, at a time when its ships were being
chased and plundered by the Genoese on every sea.
Amid the general ruin and desolation, however, Ugolino
triumphed; for now, being absolute lord of Pisa, his dearest
desire was fulfilled. Nevertheless, his power was much
less secure than he supposed, for the fiery Pisan spirit was
not entirely extinguished, and already the majority of the
citizens were growing intolerant of a tyranny at home
failing to spare them humiliations abroad. The smallest
occasion served to show that public feeling was on the
verge of an outbreak.</p>

<p>Much discontent was also provoked in the course of
negotiations with Genoa for the restitution of the prisoners,
comprising many of Pisa's best sons. Their release was
desired at any cost; but the count, knowing them to be
Ghibellines, and consequently opposed to himself, daily
invented fresh obstacles to prevent their return, and
by proposing terms the Pisans could not accept, always
caused fresh delays. Thus, as he intended, no conclusion
could be arrived at. But his arrogance finally produced
discord even among his own party. His nephew, Nino
Visconti, judge of Gallura, and the natural head of
the Guelph faction, began to make overtures to the
Ghibellines for the purpose of combating his uncle.
Thereupon Ugolino promptly sent many other Ghibellines
into exile, and demolished ten of their grandest palaces.
This produced an outburst of indignation. Nino made
close alliance with the Gualandi and Sismondi, and all tried
to hasten the prisoners' release, while the count found
fresh pretexts for delay by reviving causes of dispute
with Genoa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
After vain attempts to rouse the people against him,
Nino and his friends resorted to legal measures, hoping in
this way to curb his tyrannous excesses. He had been
nominated Captain-general of the people, but had illegally
usurped the office of Podestà in addition, and fixed his
residence in the palace of the Signory, where he had no
right to dwell. His nephew and the others sued him for this
before the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Anziani</span></i>, and obliged him to leave the palace in
conformity with the law. He obeyed for a short time, but
soon resumed his former supremacy by force. Meanwhile,
party hatred grew stronger, the count fomenting
discord with Genoa, while his enemies, as another means
to his overthrow, were doing their utmost to conclude
peace and deliver the prisoners.</p>

<p>At last the count discerned his peril, and tried to find
some way of escape. Seeing that certain Guelphs were
no less hostile than the Ghibellines and had joined with
them against him, he decided on conciliating the latter, in
order to detach them from the Guelphs who had forsaken
his cause. Thus he might at once defeat these deserters,
and, having isolated the Ghibellines, find it easy to destroy
them later on.</p>

<p>But, in spite of these ingenious devices, both parties
finally combined against him, under the command of
Archbishop Ruggiero, one of the most powerful of the
Ghibellines. Civil war raged in the city; the public palace
was alternately seized by the archbishop, and re-captured
by the count; while the latter, blinded by his fury for
revenge, rejected the warnings and advice of even his
closest adherents. One day, when the popular discontent
had come to a climax, in consequence of the high price of
provisions, and no one ventured to inform him of it, one
of his nephews demanded audience, explained the state of
things, and advised him to suspend the levying of customs,
so as to lower the price of food. But this enraged the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
count to such a point that, drawing his dagger, he stabbed
the speaker in the arm. A nephew of the archbishop
chanced to be present, and being a friend of the wounded
man, rushed forward to shield him from further attack.
Thereupon the count, maddened with fury, caught up an
axe that lay near, and with one blow stretched the intruder
dead at his feet.</p>

<p>The Archbishop Ruggieri dissimulated for a while,
waiting his chance to take revenge. It came at last. On
July 1, 1288, the council of the Republic was assembled
in the Church of St. Sebastian to discuss the arrangement
of peace with Genoa. Both the Ghibellines and people
yearned for peace at any cost; but the count raised fresh
obstacles, still relying on the support of his friends. As
the meeting dispersed, the archbishop perceived that the
favourable moment had arrived, and that no time must
be lost. The Gualandi, Sismondi, Lanfranchi and other
houses joined with him, and all proceeded to attack
Ugolino. The latter made a valiant resistance, aided by
two of his sons, two nephews, and a few devoted followers.
After the first encounter, in which Ugolino's natural son
was slain before his eyes, he took refuge in the palace of
the people, and defended it from midday to dusk, when
the besiegers decided to set it on fire. Then, forcing
their way through the flames, they captured the count,
with his two younger sons, Gaddo and Uguccione, and his
nephews Nino, surnamed Brigata, and Anselmuccio. The
prisoners were thrown into the Gualandi tower on the
Piazza degli Anziani, and Ruggieri kept them most closely
confined there for several <span class="locked">months.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></span> Finally the key of
the tower was cast into the Arno, and all left to die of
starvation, amid the torments immortalised by Dante's <span class="locked">pen.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>These events, while still further reducing the strength
of the unfortunate city, likewise caused the overthrow of
the Pisan Guelphs, by once more driving them into exile,
and promoted the hopes of the Ghibellines, who now
seemed to have gained new life in Tuscany. Accordingly
Florence was again compelled to recur to arms. Charles
I of Anjou was no more, and Pope Honorius, being
favourable to the Ghibellines, had instigated his kinsman,
Prenzivalle del Fiesco, to assume the post of vicar-imperial
in Tuscany, But as the cities of the League gave
him a very rough reception, he retired to Arezzo, and
vainly promulgated edicts against the Guelphs. By this
time no one heeded the words of Imperial vicars. On
realising this he went back to Germany, leaving Arezzo
a prey to conflicts, in which the Ghibellines won the victory,
with the help of numerous Florentine exiles. The
Guelphs sought refuge in neighbouring castles, whither
reinforcements reached them from the Florentine Signory.
Thus the war spread even to the Upper Val d'Arno; for
as the Ghibellines had returned to power, both in Arezzo
and Pisa, led by the spiritual lord of either town, they
had now to be encountered on two sides. In Pisa their
chief was the Archbishop Ubaldini, in Arezzo, Guglielmo
degli Ubertini, an equally Ghibelline prelate. The latter
was also a better warrior than priest, the lord of many
strongholds, and being of a very slippery nature, first
attempted to betray the city to the Florentines, in return for
an agreement guaranteeing him his possessions. The men
of Arezzo contrived, however, to compel him to keep
faith with his own party. On June 1, 1288, the army of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
the League took the field. It comprised nobles and <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i>
from every part of Tuscany, and together with the
mercenary troops reached a total of 2,600 horse and 12,000
foot. They carried on the campaign for twenty-two days,
capturing and razing about forty castles, great and small, on
the Aretine territory; but then a great storm wrought so
much damage to their encampments, that they were forced
to beat a retreat. As a mark of insult to the enemy, they
had held races under the walls of Arezzo, naming twelve
knights <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">di corredo</span></i>;<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> but then, raising the siege, they
went back to Florence, leaving their foes unconquered
and undismayed. In fact, when the Siennese separated
from the main body on the way to their own city, they
were surprised by a band of Aretines in ambush, and
thoroughly routed.</p>

<p>During the month of August the Florentines joined
with the Pisan Guelph exile, Nino di Gallura, made raids
on Pisan lands, and occupied the Castle of Asciano; then,
in September, they marched against the Aretines, who had
now gathered an army of seven hundred horse and eight
thousand foot. No pitched battle, however, took place,
for the enemy retreated before the Florentines, leaving
them to devastate the country at their will, but afterwards
made reprisal in the beginning of 1289, by laying
waste the Florentine territory, and penetrating almost as
far as San Donato. These variously important skirmishes
paved the way for more serious hostilities.</p>

<p>All Tuscany was now preparing for war. The captain
elected by Pisa was Count Guido da Montefeltro, who
had risen to the highest distinction by his victory over the
French troops of Charles of Anjou at the battle of Forlì.
He was undoubtedly one of the bravest warriors of the
time, and on his arrival in Pisa quickly reorganised the
militia, and created a new body of light infantry of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
thousand crossbowmen, able to do good service against
the heavy cavalry then considered the chief strength of an
army. On the other hand, the Aretines increased their
forces so much, that when Charles II. of Anjou passed
through Florence on the way to his coronation in Naples,
the Florentines were obliged to grant him an escort of
their best horse and foot soldiers, to protect him from
the attack threatened by the men of Arezzo. On this
occasion they asked the king for a good leader, to enable
them to pursue the campaign energetically, and Amerigo
de Narbonne being appointed to the post, he joined them,
accompanied by William de Durfort and one hundred
men-at-arms.</p>

<p>On June 2, 1289, the new captain, Narbonne, took the
field with an army of one thousand horse and ten thousand
foot soldiers of the League. It comprised the flower
of the Florentine nobles and commons, including six
hundred of the best-equipped knights ever furnished by
the city. Prato, Pistoia, Sienna, and all the allies, including
the Guelphs of Romagna, had sent their due contingents.
Meanwhile the Aretines had collected all the
Ghibellines from neighbouring cities, and were encamped
at Bibbiena with eight hundred horse and eight thousand
foot, under the command of their captains, the greatest
of whom was the daring Bishop Guglielmo degli Ubertini.
On finding that he could not make terms with
Florence to secure his own strongholds, without being
exposed to the vengeance of the Aretines, he had plunged
into the war with youthful ardour. His conduct was
arrogant and full of assurance; for he relied on his own
courage and that of his men, and despised the Florentines,
because, so he said, they were as sleek as womenfolk.</p>

<p>On the 11th of June the two armies met in the plain of
Poppi, near Campaldino, where the engagement began.
The battle is known by that name, and rendered all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
more celebrated by the fact of Dante Alighieri&mdash;then
young and unknown&mdash;having fought in it. The Florentines
had placed a mixed host of infantry, crossbowmen,
and bucklermen in the van, and their wings were
formed of 150 skirmishing light horse, who were all
picked men. Vieri de' Cerchi was among the latter; for,
having been entrusted with the choice of those of his
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestiere</span></i>, he insisted, in spite of illness, on accompanying
his son and nephews to the battlefield. In the rear of
the first division a stronger force of heavy cavalry and
infantry was drawn up, with the baggage-train behind.
Corso Donati led a band of about 250 foot and horse
from Lucca, Pistoia, and foreign parts. He was
Podestà of Pistoia at the time, and was directed to
hold his reserve back until the commander-in-chief gave
the signal to advance. On either side there was a fever of
emulation between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, and
to gratify the ambition of their respective leaders, some
were awarded the honour of knighthood that day, in
order to spur them to greater feats. The Florentines
were under orders to await the enemy's charge, and Messer
Simone dei Mangiadori of San Miniato shouted to his
men, "Signori! our Tuscan battles used to be won by
vigorous assault, but are now to be won by standing still."
The Aretines, on the contrary, trusting to their own
courage and their leader's skill, made so impetuous a
charge to the cry of "<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Viva San Donato!</span></i>" that the Florentine
army wavered, and gave way before the shock.
Nearly all the light horse were hurled from their saddles,
and the main body fell back. But the foot soldiers flanking
the second corps moved forward to the cry of
"<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Narbona cavaliere!</span></i>" and by threatening to surround
the enemy, checked its advance, and thus gave their
comrades time to re-form. Count Guido Novello, in
command of 150 Aretine mounted skirmishers, lost his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
presence of mind, and by failing to attack the foe at the
moment when their ranks were in confusion, caused much
harm by the delay. But this was his usual behaviour,
and presently, as the fight grew hotter, he took to
flight&mdash;also as usual. On the other hand, Corso Donati,
although instructed to keep his men steady, and not to
advance until expressly summoned, could not remain
inert on beholding the Florentines waver at the first
shock of encounter, and cried aloud, "If we lose, I will
perish with my fellow-citizens; if we win, let who likes
come to Pistoia to punish our disobedience;" and so
saying, gave the command to take the enemy in flank.
Thus the attacking Aretines were now charged in their
turn. They made an admirable resistance, and their
cavalry being insufficient, the infantry crawled on all fours
among the advancing troops, and disembowelled their
steeds. But no prodigies of personal courage could avail
to decide the battle. There was a fierce and prolonged
mêlée; the Florentines fought stubbornly, and nearly all
the leaders of the Aretines were killed. Archbishop
Ubertini fell, sword in hand; so, too, his nephew,
Guglielmino dei Pazzi, held to be one of the bravest
captains in Italy, and Buonconte, the Count of Montefeltro's
son. Many Florentines perished, including three
of the Uberti and one of the Abbati. Count Guido
Novello alone saved his skin by flight. The Aretines
were thoroughly routed, and, according to Villani, left
seventeen hundred dead on the field, and two thousand
prisoners in the enemy's hands. But of these only
740 reached Florence, the rest having escaped or been
ransomed. This is not very surprising, when we remember
that in these Guelph and Ghibelline wars fellow-citizens,
and old friends or relations, often had to meet
in combat; and that consequently leniency was more
natural than hatred, although there are only too many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
instances of the ferocity to which the latter feeling
was carried. The Florentine losses were slight and unimportant.
Corso Donati, whose daring charge greatly
contributed to decide the struggle, and Vieri de' Cerchi
were both covered with glory. Many men previously
deemed of little account won high reputation that day,
while many others forfeited their fame. At any rate, all
the best citizens and captains returned safely to Florence,
and there was general rejoicing in the <span class="locked">city.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></span></p>

<p>The Florentines had felt assured of victory from the
outset. In fact we are told that the priors, having
fallen asleep on the day of the battle, worn out by
their previous vigils, they were suddenly awakened by
the sound of a voice seeming to cry: "Arise, for the Aretines
are beaten." At that moment all the citizens were
in the streets, waiting impatiently the arrival of news.
At last the desired messenger appeared, and there was an
outburst of joy and festivity. Later on discontent was
excited by hearing that the army had failed to follow up
the victory by giving pursuit to the foe. For had the
latter been driven back into Arezzo, that town might
have been easily seized. Instead of this, the forces captured
Bibbiena, belonging to the bishop, plundered several
castles, and devastated the country for twenty days.
They ran races round the walls of Arezzo, and used their
rams to drop asses crowned with mitres into the town, in
order to insult its inhabitants. But they suspended all
serious hostilities for the time, although, when the new
priors had been chosen, the government at once despatched
two of them to the camp, in order to push forward the
war in person, and hasten the capture of the city. But
the favourable moment had passed, for the Aretines made
some successful sallies, and set fire to all the besiegers'
engines of assault. Accordingly, leaving a sufficient force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
to guard the captured castles and unfinished siege-works,
the Florentines returned home on the 23rd of July, much
to the displeasure of the citizens, who murmured that the
enemy's gold must have been poured into the camp.
Nevertheless, a great victory had been won, and the soldiers
were received with vast demonstrations of delight. All
the people, with the banners and insignia of every guild,
and the whole of the clergy, went forth in procession to
welcome the conquerors. The Captain, Amerigo de Narbonne,
and Ugolino de' Rossi, the Podestà, entered the
town in state, beneath sumptuous canopies of cloth of
gold, borne by the noblest of Florentine knights. The
entire cost of the campaign was paid by levying a property
tax of six <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>, six <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soldi</span></i> per cent. in the city and its territory.
This tax soon yielded a product of thirty-six
thousand gold florins, owing, as Villani remarks (vii. 132),
to the admirable administration and organisation of the
financial affairs of the Commune at that time.</p>

<p>After humiliating the two hostile cities of Arezzo and
Pisa, the Florentine Republic had overthrown the Ghibellines
and assured the triumph of the Guelphs throughout
Tuscany, and thus gained almost unlimited influence, both
political and commercial. Hence there was a vast and
rapid increase of prosperity. Great festivities and banquets
were held in all the wealthiest houses, and palace courtyards,
covered with silken canopies and draped with gorgeous
stuffs, served as places of entertainment for the citizens.
In token of rejoicing the womenfolk paraded the streets
wearing garlands of flowers. Nevertheless, there was a
general wish to continue the war, in the hope of completing
the overthrow of the two most powerful Ghibelline
cities. This, however, was no easy task.</p>

<p>In 1289 there were fresh skirmishes between the Guelphs
and Ghibellines, although none of any importance. The
Florentines made several attempts to capture Arezzo by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
force and by fraud, but always in vain. In November
they had contrived a secret arrangement by means of which
it was hoped to surprise the city. A decree was suddenly
issued summoning all able-bodied men to assemble outside
the walls before a candle lighted at one of the gates
should have time to burn down. The army thus hastily
gathered made a forced march on Arezzo; but the treason
plotted there had been already discovered: a dying man,
rumour said, having revealed it to his confessor. At any
rate, the army was obliged to withdraw from a bootless
errand.</p>

<p>In the June of the ensuing year, 1290, the Florentines
resumed the campaign with an army of 1,500 horse and
6,000 foot, furnished by the League. Surrounding Arezzo,
they devastated the territory within a circuit of six miles,
for the space of twenty-nine days, but without achieving
any farther result. At that period all cities were fortified,
and before the invention of gunpowder siege operations
had no chance of success, save by treason, against a resolute
defence. Now, too, the Florentines were trying to carry
on a double campaign, against Arezzo on the one hand
and Pisa on the other. In fact, presently leaving three
hundred horse and a considerable number of foot soldiers
to garrison the neighbouring strongholds, they transferred
the rest of the army from the Upper to the Lower Val
d'Arno, to act against Pisa.</p>

<p>In the preceding year, aided by Florence and the
League, Lucca had taken the field with four hundred
horse and two thousand foot, in order to carry on the war
with Pisa, while the Florentines were busied with Arezzo.
This force encamped before Pisa, and, according to usage,
held races there; harried the territory for twenty-five
days, captured the Castle of Caprona, and made several
assaults on Vico Pisano, but achieved no farther result.
Now, in 1290, the Florentines resumed the attack in combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
with all the great forces of the League. And while
this army was making a general attack by land, the Genoese
fleet swooped down on the coast with deadly effect.
Leghorn and Porto Pisano were taken, the four towers
guarding the harbour were thrown into the sea, and the
Meloria lighthouse destroyed in the same way, together
with its keepers. Before setting sail the Genoese blocked
the mouth of the harbour by sinking four ships laden with
ballast, and demolished all warehouses and palaces. But
the havoc wrought by land was confined to the destruction
of crops and the demolition of petty strongholds. Meanwhile
the Pisans made a brave resistance on all sides.
Guido di Montefeltro, their captain, used his newly
invented troop of light horse to excellent effect against
the Tuscan infantry of the League and the heavy cavalry
in its pay. By his successful sallies he repeatedly achieved
a bloody revenge for past losses. In December, 1291,
the Pisans marched on the Castle of Pontedera, and finding
it slackly defended, accomplished its capture, and shortly
afterwards stirred the Castle of Vignale to revolt against
San Miniato. Thereupon the Florentines decided on
sending an army to provoke a fresh engagement; but the
expedition was too long delayed, and the troops had hardly
started before torrents of rain inundated the country and
compelled them to retreat.</p>

<p>Military operations now slackened more and more,
for mischief was brewing in the city, and all men foresaw
that worse troubles were at hand. Therefore, although
urged to resume hostilities by their valiant and energetic
leader, the Judge of Gallura, the Florentines so sorely
needed tranquillity that they finally concluded a treaty of
peace at Fucecchio on June 12, 1293. According to its
stipulations, all prisoners of war were to be released; no
duties were to be levied on inhabitants of the communes
of the League in passing through Pisa, nor on Pisans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
passing through the said communes. The office of Podestà
or Captain of Pisa was only to be held by a member of
the League, and it was expressly forbidden to confer that
post on any rebel or adversary of the said League, or any
scion of the Montefeltro house. Further, Count Guido,
the brave chief who had shown so much energy and daring
in defence of the Pisan Republic, was to be dismissed,
together with all the foreign Ghibellines; and twenty-five
citizens of the best Pisan blood were to be given in
hostage to secure the due observance of the terms. Such
was the reward of the veteran leader's fidelity and heroism!
On being paid off, he entered the council chamber, and
after reproving the ingratitude of the Pisans in dignified
words, took his leave without expressing any wish for
revenge. Yet, being still in command of an experienced
army devoted to himself, vengeance lay in his power, had
he chosen to follow the fashion of the times. Another
clause of the treaty provided that the descendants of Count
Ugolino and the Judge of Gallura should be freed from
outlawry and reinstated in all their <span class="locked">possessions.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></span></p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>From this moment the Florentines devoted their chief
attention to the affairs of the city, although these had not
been altogether neglected, even during the last wars. Continual
improvements had been made in the administration
of the Republic, and in many respects it was a model
administration, while there was also a notable increase of
commerce, trade, and wealth. At the same time many
public works had been completed under the direction of
the famous architect Arnolfo di Cambio, the creator of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
some of the grandest public buildings in Florence. He
planned the alterations for the enlargement of the city,
first undertaken in 1285, and afterwards built the third
circuit of walls, the which work was also superintended by
the celebrated chronicler Giovanni Villani. It was likewise
by Arnolfo's care that the Loggia of Or' San Michele, then
used as a corn market, was built in and paved, the Piazza
dei Signori supplied with a pavement, and the Badia embellished
and restored. Folco Portinari, the father of Dante's
Beatrice, founded, at his own expense, the church and
hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. The Piazza of Santa
Maria Novella was laid out, and many other public works
of a similar kind were <span class="locked">begun.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile political reforms were uninterruptedly carried
on, and among them the notable measure passed in 1289,
reducing the Podestà's term of office from twelve to six
<span class="locked">months.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></span> The post was then conferred on Rosso Gabrielli
of Gubbio, a city supplying many Podestàs and Captains
of the people not only to Florence, but to all parts of Italy.
At that period Romagna, Umbria, and the Marches
seemed to be a nursery of these dignitaries, the inhabitants
of those provinces being not only well trained to
arms, as is proved by the horde of captains and soldiers
of adventure they sent forth, but also well versed in
the legal lore of the neighbouring university of Bologna.
This reduction to six months of the Podestà's tenure
of office was not long maintained, but had been decreed
for the same motives as the change of Signory every
two months. The power of a magistrate authorised to
administer justice, in command of the army and invariably
escorted by a body of armed followers in his private pay,
might be easily transformed into a formidable despotism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
as several Italian republics had already found to their
cost. Hence it was endeavoured to avert this danger
from Florence by changing the magistrates so frequently
as to allow no time for hatching plots against the Commonwealth,
or forming a party whose adherence could be
counted on for any length of time.</p>

<p>But political and social changes of a very different and
far graver kind were now brewing among the citizens of
Florence. Signs of a new and radical transformation were
becoming daily more pronounced; hence the greater need
of assuring peace in order to withstand the inevitable
and imminent shock of coming revolutions. The
presence of the Angevins in Florence, the example set by
their nobles, and their continual creation of new knights,
had swelled the arrogance of the leading Guelphs to a
boundless extent. These patricians were now known by
the name of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>, and in imitation of the French
nobility assumed manners ill-suited to a republican state,
trying to rule everything and all men according to their
will. A serious riot took place in 1287, because one of these
chieftains, named Totto Mazzinghi, being condemned to
death by the Podestà for murder and other crimes,
Messer Corco Donati, one of the leading nobles of
Florence, attempted to rescue him by force on the way to
the scaffold. Thereupon the Podestà, resenting such
open violation of the law, caused the alarm bell to be
rung. The people flocked to the place of execution
sword in hand, some mounted, some on foot, to the cry
of "<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Giustizia, Giustizia!</span></i>" and the sentence was then
carried out with the uttermost rigour of the law. The
condemned Mazzinghi was dragged through the streets
before being hung; the promoters of the revolt against
the magistrates were heavily fined, and order was re-established
in the city. But these disturbances were indicative
of deeper evils to come, and Florentine statesmen were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
full of anxiety. In order to check the arrogance of the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>, and prevent them from combining with the
populace, the middle-class Guelphs began to grant political
rights on a continuously wider scale, while restricting the
power of the nobles. As we have already seen, the latter
had been obliged to provide sureties personally responsible
for their actions, to swear to abstain from deeds of
vengeance, from oppressing the people and so forth.
The very remarkable law passed on August 6, 1289,
served to overthrow the might of the nobles, both within
and without the city walls, and to enhance that of the
people by destroying the last lingering remains of the
feudal system. Thanks to this decree, serfdom was
entirely abolished throughout the territory; for in terms
resembling a proclamation of the rights of man, it declared
liberty to be an imprescriptible, natural right, a right
never to be dependent on another's will; and that the
Republic was determined not only to maintain liberty
intact throughout its dominions, but likewise increase the
<span class="locked">same.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></span> Thus every species of bondage, whether for a
term or for life, was abolished, together with all contracts
or agreements infringing on the liberty of the individual.</p>

<p>It has been thought by some writers that the Commune
of Bölogna had already achieved this most important
reform in 1256, and that Florence only followed its
example thirty-three years later. But this was an error
induced by supposing that in the Italian communes the
abolition of serfdom was completed at one stroke, whereas,
on the contrary, it was carried out very slowly and in
different degrees. In the territory there were not only
<i>nobles</i> and their <i>serfs</i>, but also <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">fideles</span></i>, whose personality
was already recognised by law, but who still remained dependents
of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">nobiles</span></i> and bound to yield them service
and tribute. At a later date the condition of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">fideles</span></i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
was further ameliorated; they could hold land in fee from
their lords, or by payment of a yearly rent (a <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">livello</span></i>), but
remained bound to them on terms of villeinage, and
therefore bound to the soil. For this reason the lords
believed, or feigned to believe themselves entitled to sell
the soil, together with the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">fideles</span></i> attached to it, even when
this was no longer in accordance with the spirit of the law.
The Bölognese abolished serfdom in 1256, but the
peasantry remained in their master's dependence, that is,
more or less as <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">fideles</span></i>, and although these conditions were
ameliorated in 1283 they were not altogether abrogated.
But even earlier than 1289 serfs had ceased to exist in
the Florentine territory, and, judicially, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">fideles</span></i> had been
long considered almost independent of their masters,
although the latter, by the abuse of purely personal contracts,
often compelled them to remain attached to the
soil and claimed the right of disposing of them, as well as
of the land. These were the abuses condemned and suppressed
by the Florentines in 1289, as being adverse to
liberty, "the which is a natural and therefore inalienable
right." The new law likewise decreed that in consequence
of this natural right all the above-mentioned sales became
null and void; and cancelling every illegal contract, it
finally guaranteed complete freedom to the peasantry.
And by another clause every peasant was thenceforth
enabled (irrespective of any sale of the land) to purchase
his emancipation from any personal contract binding him
to the proprietor of the soil. Thus the law of 1289 did
not abolish serfdom, inasmuch as that institution had been
already suppressed by the Florentines some time before,
but it assured, for the first time, complete liberty to the
cultivators of the soil. Economically, the new law was
very advantageous to the Commune, by converting the
peasantry into direct contributors, and no less advantageous
to the democracy, inasmuch as it broke the last links of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
the feudal system, and weakened the power of the nobles
throughout the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<p>Many other measures were also passed in 1289 and
1290 for the purpose of strengthening the position of the
people in the city, and serving to show that Florence
steadily pursued the work of political and social transformation.
First of all, the number of legally constituted
guilds was increased by adding five more to the seven
greater guilds, and all having their special insignia, organisation,
arms, and political <span class="locked">attributes.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></span> We now find
records of twelve greater guilds in the archives of the
Republic, whereas, previously to this date, seven only were
mentioned. It is true that the number was very soon
reduced again to seven; but then the five omitted were
joined to nine others, these fourteen designated as the
lesser guilds, and the total number of the guilds was
finally fixed at twenty-one. In 1290 another law was
passed, called <i>the law of prohibition</i>, decreeing that no
prior could be re-elected to office until three years had
elapsed. Later on this prohibition was partially extended
even to the kinsmen of a <span class="locked">prior.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></span> The scope of these
measures was always to prevent the rise of any future
tyranny and to keep the growing arrogance of the nobles
in check.</p>

<p>Other laws were also framed for the same purpose.
As, for instance, the two decrees carried almost unanimously
on June 30, and July 3, <span class="locked">1290.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></span> By these all guild-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>masters
were prohibited, under severe penalties, from
forming monopolies, agreements, compacts, fictitious sales,
or other arrangements tending to the imposition of
arbitrary prices, regardless of the rules prescribed by
statute. And not only the individuals guilty of such
infringement were subject to punishment and to be
mulcted in the sum of 100 <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>, but the guild to which
they belonged was also subject to a fine of 500 <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i> for
neglecting to enforce obedience to the laws, and its
rectors and consuls were to be mulcted in 200 <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>.</p>

<p>On January 2, 1291, another law was passed of a far
weightier import, with the clearly expressed aim of curbing
by force the wolfish rapacity of the nobles (volentes
lupinas carnes salsamentis caninis involvi).<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> This decree
rigorously prohibited recourse to any tribunal or magistrate
save to the legally constituted authorities, such as the
priors, the Captain, Podestà, or the judges in ordinary of
the Commune. All persons having obtained from the
Pope, Emperor, King Charles, or their respective vicars
exemptions of any kind, or right of appeal to other magistrates,
and pretending to exercise such right, and all
persons who, with the same intent, should assert the power
of exercising old feudal privileges, were warned to refrain
from attempting to use such rights under penalty of the
severest punishment. The new law minutely described
different forms of similar fictitious exemptions, and
determined the penalties incurred by their use. What
seems strangest of all is, that this law decreed the punishment
not only of persons asserting and trying to exercise
the above-mentioned rights, of the notaries transcribing
the acts, and the lawyers declaring them valid; but in
cases where the real criminals should escape punishment, it
likewise held responsible the relations and distant connections
of the guilty, and even their labourers and tenants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
At that period the populace, the well-to-do burghers and
the nobles (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>) formed as it were three classes of
citizens, or, indeed, three distinct social bodies, who both
for offence and defence, in all questions of party rancour,
revenge or political privilege, acted as though every one
was willingly and of necessity bound to be responsible for
the deeds of his colleagues. Hence, recognising this state
of things, certain extreme measures were decreed, which,
although opportune and even imperative at the moment&mdash;in
order to forward the democratic cause by assisting the
weak to struggle against the powerful class&mdash;were none
the less arbitrary. However, the necessity of employing
the most stringent remedies was becoming daily more
obvious. The nobles had been too much uplifted by the
favours heaped on them by the Pope and the Angevins.
And the brilliant success recently achieved at Campaldino,
where victory had been decided by the prowess of Corso
Donati and Vieri de' Cerchi, had so swelled their pride
that they openly vaunted their contempt for the law, and
constantly violated its prescriptions. This state of things
finally produced the revolution of 1293, resulting in the
constitution of the second popular government (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">il secondo
popolo</span></i>) and the total overthrow of the nobles.</p>

together with the provision itself (State Archives, Florence, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Provvisioni</span></i>,
Registro iv. c. 29). And on the 3rd of July, by reason of
the former amendment, the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">priori</span></i> of the guilds, together with the
other wise men consulted by them, decreed: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quod nulli Consules

be read in the captain's council every month and cried about the
city. (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Provvisioni</span></i>, Registro, iv. a. c. 30&ndash;31.)</p></blockquote>

<h3>NOTE C.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>On the 31st of January (new style, 1291) a provision was made,
beginning with this singular proemium:&mdash;"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ad honorem, ec. Ut

<p>It goes on to severely forbid that any one should dare to:
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">aliquas litteras impetrare vel impetrari facere, aut privilegium vel

falsified, did not cease from falsifying, when reprimanded, and failed to
pay damages and interest within three days, was to be fined one hundred
small <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">fiorini</span></i>, or more, according to the judgment of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Podestà</span></i>
or of the captain, or of any other magistrate who had undertaken the

of the magistrates, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">teneantur Potestas et Capitaneus, qui de

<p>Moreover, as we have said before, any one, who in the city,
Commune, or district of Florence, directly or indirectly published such
acts, together with the notary who wrote them out, and the lawyer
who defended them, was subject to severe penalties. The Podestà
and the captain could proceed as they pleased against any one who,

And as usual the penalties could be applied to relations.</p>

<p>As it happened that many requested the support of civil justice

decreed that this support should be given only when the suit was over,
before competent magistrates, and after it had been examined. If in
this case the magistrates refused, then action could be taken against
them. But otherwise, those who should demand an unjust sentence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
were subject to penalties, together with their relations, according to
the first paragraph of this law. "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Verum si consanguineos, ut dictum

<div><img src="images/i_t.jpg" class="drop-capi" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">THE</span> end of the thirteenth century marks
the opening of a new era in the history
of Italy and of Europe. During the
period of political disorder prevailing
throughout Northern Europe ever since
the days of Charlemagne, a literary
culture was nevertheless developed, which, although little
heeded in past times, has been most clearly elucidated by
recent learned research. The literature of Provence, the
romance of chivalry, the poems arranged in the cycles of
Charlemagne, the Round Table, the Nibelungen Lied,
the innumerable ballads, the splendid cathedrals reared
on both banks of the Rhine and constituting an art
never to be surpassed by its countless imitators, were one
and all the offspring of the mighty, primitive culture of
the Middle Ages, in which, for a long time, Italy had no
share. In Northern Europe, where conquerors and
conquered amalgamated with less difficulty, national art
and literature were sooner able to spring into being. In
Italy, on the contrary, the conquered were oppressed, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
never entirely fused with their conquerors; gradually,
rather, they began to assert their individuality and their
rights. The original rise of the communes was the result
of this struggle. Accordingly, at the time when France
was composing love-songs and poems of chivalry, Italy was
absorbed in founding political institutions and preparing
to win freedom.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fourteenth century the scene
was completely changed. Every branch of mediæval
literature seemed smitten with an instantaneous decay,
northern imagination and fancy to be suddenly withered.
Even there, in the north, men begin to strive, slowly and
painfully, at the task of political organisation. Meanwhile,
the Italian communes being already constituted,
our country had already given birth to a national
literature, of so dazzling a splendour as to banish all
others from view, and relegate to centuries of oblivion the
fruits of earlier culture elsewhere. It was precisely at
this moment that Florence, then the chief seat and centre
of the new Italian culture, was subject to the rule of the
greater guilds. The Empire seemed to have abandoned
its pretensions with regard to Italy; the Papacy, weakened
and menaced, no longer dared to impose its commands
on the secular world in its former imperious fashion; the
struggle between conquerors and conquered had come to
an end, all distinction between the German and Latin
races having utterly disappeared, and Italy being peopled
by Italians alone.</p>

<p>Now, too, the prolonged conflict waged by the
democracy of Florence against the feudal aristocracy was
about to terminate in the former's victory, and the Commonwealth
could be justly entitled a Republic of merchants,
whose trade was soon to enrich them to an apparently
fabulous extent. All seemed to herald a new era of
peace, prosperity, and concord. But in the light of after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
events we perceive that the Republic continued to be
sorely harassed by internecine strife; also that, in spite of
the splendid results achieved in art and commerce,
political institutions were on the wane, and the loss of
liberty becoming almost a foregone conclusion. How
was it that a Commune, enabled to assert its existence at
the beginning of the twelfth century and steadily progress
in the face of tremendous obstacles, should now show
symptoms of decline in the heyday of its triumph?
How was it that civil war should still be carried on when
all motive for discord seemed extinguished by the victory
of the popular party now at the head of the State? We
shall discover the answer to this problem by investigating
more closely the new conditions of Florentine society, and
more particularly the conditions of the trade guilds
constituting its chief strength and nucleus.</p>

<p>The number of the Florentine guilds welded in associations
had been, after various changes, finally fixed at
twenty-one: seven greater and fourteen lesser guilds,
although often found otherwise divided into twelve
greater and twelve lesser. At any rate, the guilds of
first rank and decidedly highest importance were the
<span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. The Guild of Judges and Notaries.<br /></li>
<li>2. The Guild of Calimala, or Dressers of Foreign Cloth.<br /></li>
<li>3. The Guild of Wool.<br /></li>
<li>4. The Guild of Silk, or of Porta Santa Maria.<br /></li>
<li>5. The Guild of Money-changers.<br /></li>
<li>6. The Guild of Doctors and Druggists.<br /></li>
<li>7. The Guild of Skinners and Furriers.<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>As every one can see, the first on the list is altogether
outside the limits of trade and commerce, and seems
rather to belong to the learned professions. But it may
be remarked that in those days judges and notaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
contributed very largely to the advancement of the guilds,
and were continually employed in their service. Together
with the consuls, they constituted the court or tribunal
of every guild, and gave judgment in all commercial suits
tried there; they arranged all disputes, pronounced or
suggested penal sentences. Then, too, it was the peculiar
function of the notaries to draw up new statutes,
continually reform them, and provide for their due
enforcement. They were likewise engaged to prepare
contracts, and were frequently the mouthpieces of the
consuls at the meetings of the greater and lesser guilds.
Good judges and notaries were in great demand throughout
Italy, and, as necessary instruments of prosperity,
richly remunerated for their services. Accordingly, their
guild became one of the most influential in Florence, and
its notaries were reputed the best-skilled in the
world. Goro Dati speaks of this guild in his "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Storia di
Firenze</span>," saying that "it has a proconsul at the head of
its consuls, wields great authority, and may be considered
the parent stem of the whole notarial profession throughout
Christendom, inasmuch as the great masters of that
profession have been leaders and members of this Guild.
Bologna is the fountain of doctors of the law, Florence of
doctors of the <span class="locked">notariate."<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></span> At public functions the
proconsul took precedence over all the consuls, and came
directly after the chief magistrate of the Republic. As
head of the judges and notaries he held judicial authority,
as it were, over all the guilds.</p>

<p>The four next in order&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Calimala, Wool, Silk,
and Exchange&mdash;commanded the largest share of Florentine
commerce and industry. They were of very ancient
origin. Ammirato remarks that the consuls of the
guilds are mentioned in a Patent of 1204, but there is
documentary record of them at a much earlier date. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
although boasting so old an existence, the guilds passed
through a long period of gradual formation, only
developing their strength much later, and each at a different
time. The oldest and also the first to make progress
were the Calimala and Wool Guilds, virtually exercising
almost the same industry, inasmuch as both dressed
woollen stuffs, and carried on an extensive business with
them. Nevertheless, seeing that each pursued its trade in
a way peculiar to itself, and achieved thereby a special
individual importance, the two guilds always remained
separate and distinct from each other.</p>

<p>From the earliest mediæval times the manners and
customs of the Italians had been more refined and civilised
than those of barbarian peoples, and their handicraft far
more advanced. We learn from a chronicler, quoted in
Muratori, that when Charlemagne was in Italy he wished
to go out hunting one day, and suddenly summoned his
courtiers from Pavia. Precious Eastern stuffs having been
already brought to that town by the Venetians, the
courtiers were able to appear before the emperor clad in
the richest attire. But during the hunt their precious
stuffs and feathers were totally spoiled by rain and thorns,
whereas the emperor's plain tunic of goatskin was as
good as before. Thereupon Charlemagne turned to his
followers and said, rather jeeringly: "Why do you throw
away your money so fruitlessly, when you might wear
skins, the most convenient, lasting, and least expensive of
garments?"<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> We may certainly doubt the historic truth
of this incident; but the chronicler's tale proves two
things at all events, <i>i.e.</i>, that the custom of wearing the
skins of goats or lambs was so general in the ninth
century, that even an emperor might not disdain their
use; and that, although Italian industry was then very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
undeveloped, beautiful stuffs were procured from the
Levant through the Venetian traders.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The art of weaving coarse woollen stuffs is, however,
so easy that it must have been soon revived in Italy, and
was probably never completely abandoned. It would
seem to have first begun to progress by imitating the
simpler fabrics of the Eastern Empire, where cultivation
and industry had survived to a much later date. In fact,
all the earlier Italian stuffs bear names indicative of their
Byzantine derivation, such, for instance, as <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Velum
holosericum</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Fundathum alithinum</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Vela tiria</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">bizantina</span></i>,
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Crysoclava</span></i>, <i>&amp;c.</i><a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> Nevertheless, although the craft of
woollen manufacture is of very early origin, and was even
practised by pastoral tribes, there were many obstacles to
its development in Italy. Improvement in the breeding
of sheep, and consequently in pasturing and agriculture,
was required for its progress. But, whereas the Italian
communes showed great solicitude for the promotion of
trade, they not only despised but often crushed
agriculture. The Republic was constituted and governed
by artisans, who, after overthrowing the feudal lords, rose
to supremacy; but the agricultural class, although far
better treated in Tuscany than elsewhere, remained long
bound to the soil, and never enjoyed rights of citizenship.
This fact alone serves to indicate the rest. All laws and
decrees relating to trade are full of good sense and
foresight; while all concerning agriculture seem dictated
by prejudice or jealousy.</p>

<p>Then, too, regarding pasturage and consequently the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
woollen industry, it should be added that Tuscany, being
a mountainous country, is adapted to the culture of vines
and olives and excellent cereals, but deficient in meadowland,
whether natural or artificial. Accordingly, it was
an exceedingly difficult task to improve the quality and
quantity of the wool produced there. Although the
Florentines soon succeeded in manufacturing the woollen
stuffs called <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">pignolati</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">schiavini</span></i>, and <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">villaneschi</span></i>, these
very coarse fabrics, the names of which sufficiently indicate
their quality, only served for a limited trade in the
territory or just beyond the borders of the Republic.
And when it was attempted to improve the manufacture
serious difficulties arose. To weave fine cloth from coarse
wool was a fruitless labour; while to procure foreign wool
from distant countries was no easy task in times when
industry and commerce had scarcely any existence, and
the cost of transport would have devoured the profits.
Nevertheless, it was by conquering all these obstacles that
the Florentines gave the first proofs of their genius for
trade.</p>

<p>In Flanders, Holland, and Brabant far better wool was
obtainable, and the art of weaving it so long established
there that, as in the case of the linen webs of North
Germany, the origin of the craft is lost in the obscurity of
almost pre-historic times. But, notwithstanding the good
quality of the yarn, the woollen stuffs manufactured in
those countries were decidedly coarse, sent to market
undressed, badly-finished, and dyed in very ugly and
evanescent colours. Accordingly the Florentine merchants
conceived the idea of importing these foreign stuffs
in order to dress and dye them in their own workshops.
Hence the origin of the Calimala or Calimara <span class="locked">craft.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></span>
Bales of cloth began to arrive from Flanders, Holland,
and Brabant, and these so-called <i>Frankish</i> or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ultramontane</span></i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
stuffs were carded, shaved, dressed, and cut in Florence.
This treatment removed all the knots coarsening the surface,
and as the material was much finer than Italian wool it could
be easily dyed in very delicate tints, and the Florentines
soon surpassed all competitors in this particular art. Then,
after being carefully ironed, faced, and folded, the cloth
was re-sold in a very different condition and at a much
higher price. From the first there was a great demand
for these goods in Italy, and they were afterwards sent to
the East, and bartered for drugs, dyes, and other Asiatic
products. Finally, as their quality went on improving,
they found their way to France, England, and the same
markets whence they had originally come, and where they
were sold in exchange for undressed fabrics. Thus the
lack of original material was not only supplied, but
foreign manufactures served to swell Florentine gains.
A very extensive trade was carried on with comparatively
little trouble, and as the process of wool-dressing gave
employment to many hands, the Calimala Guild attained
a position of great influence that was naturally shared
by the Guild of <span class="locked">Wool.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span></p>

<p>In fact, the latter being stirred by emulation and greed
for profit, used the utmost care to improve its manufactures.
And the development of the craft was equally
assisted by the labours of private individuals and the wise
measures decreed by the State. At that time there was
a monastic order in Italy known as the Humble Friars,
originally founded by a few Lombard exiles, who, on
being banished to North Germany in 1014 by Henry I.,
had learnt the very ancient craft of wool-weaving practised
there. Later on, having formed a pious association, the
exiles laboured at the trade for their bread, and after five
years' absence returned home a united band of workers.
Down to the year 1140 they remained laymen, but then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
decided to form a religious order, afterwards sanctioned
by Pope Innocent III. Once admitted to the priesthood,
they no longer worked with their own hands, but retained
the management of the business, had it carried on by laymen
under the direction of a <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">mercatore</span></i>, and continually
introduced new improvements. It was natural that cultivated
men, with members of their order scattered over
various provinces, should be able to forward the progress
of the trade they had founded. In fact, they acquired so
much celebrity for their administrative talents that we find
them engaged at Florence and elsewhere as treasurers of
the public revenue (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">camarlinghi</span></i>) and as army contractors
in time of war. Wherever a house of their order was
established the wool-weaving craft immediately made
advance. Hence, with its usual sharpsighted wisdom
touching all questions of trade and commerce, the Florentine
Republic, considering the houses of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Umiliati</span></i> to be
great industrial schools, invited the friars to establish a
branch in the neighbourhood of Florence.</p>

<p>Accordingly in 1239 the Humble Brethren arrived and
settled near the city in the Church of San Donato a Torri,
granted to them by the State. Their presence led to the
expected result. Before long their house became one of
the principal centres of Florentine industry, so that the
guild-masters complained of the friars' distance from the
town, and urged them to move their establishment nearer
to the walls. In 1250 they obtained buildings and land
in the suburb of Sta Lucia sul Prato, and exemption from
all taxes on their property, the which privilege was usually
accorded by the Florentines to any one introducing a new
branch of trade in the city. Then, in 1256, the Umiliati
founded the church and monastery of Sta Caterina, in
Borgo Ognissanti, and carved their arms over the entrance,
<i>i.e.</i>, a wool-pack fastened crosswise by ropes. From that
moment the wool craft made enormous advance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Florence, and in every European market Florentine cloths
began to rank above all others. Efforts were made to
improve the rough material and to use additional care in
dressing it, finer wools being imported from Tunis,
Barbary, Spain, Portugal, Flanders, and lastly even from
England. Thus so vast a trade was established, such
great wealth accumulated, that the wool craft rivalled
and surpassed the Calimala itself. Both guilds became
great commercial powers in Europe, while in Florence the
government dared not oppose their <span class="locked">decisions.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></span></p>

<p>Giovanni Villani informs us, in his valuable account of
Florentine statistics during the year 1338, that there were
more than two hundred wool factories, turning out from
seventy thousand to eighty thousand pieces of cloth, of
the total value of one million two hundred thousand
florins, "of the which sum a good third was kept at home
for the works, without counting the earnings of the wool
dressers in the said works, the which supplied a living to
over thirty thousand persons." The chief profits of the
trade were obtained by perfection of manufacture, rather
than by any increase of produce. Even Villani remarked
that thirty years earlier, that is, in 1308, the factories were
more numerous, actually as many as three hundred, and
producing one hundred thousand pieces of cloth: "but
these stuffs were coarser, and of only half the value,
having no intermixture of English wool, the which indeed
they had not yet learnt to dress with the skill since
<span class="locked">acquired."<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></span> This clearly shows that the craft owed its
first improvement in the thirteenth century to the
Humble Friars, and was carried to perfection in the
fifteenth century by the introduction of English woollens.</p>

<p>In the same year of 1338 the Calimala Guild owned
twenty warehouses in Florence, "yearly receiving more
than ten thousand pieces of cloth, to the value of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
hundred thousand florins, all sold in Florence, and without
including those sent out of the <span class="locked">city."<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></span> The Calimala
craftsmen were exceedingly skilled as refiners and dyers,
and particularly successful in preparing the crimson cloth
for which there was a great demand in Florence, as it was
used for the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lucco</span></i>, a hooded robe worn by all citizens
entitled to enter the Public Palace and sit in the tribunals
or councils of the Republic. The two guilds afterwards
made a division of labour in order to avoid infringing
each others rights. The statutes absolutely prohibited
the Calimala from dying anything save foreign stuffs, and
the Woollen Guild had dyers of its own, forming, as it
were, a subordinate association. These dyers were bound
to deposit three hundred florins with the guild as a
warranty, and fines were deducted from this sum whenever
the goods delivered were soiled or dyed a bad
colour. The officers of the guilds were exceedingly
severe on these points. Every inch of cloth underwent
the minutest examination, and the least defect in colour,
quality, or measure exposed the workman to heavy
penalties. Some of these great Florentine guilds were
not composed solely of one trade, but were often
agglomerations of various crafts, particularly in the case
of the Wool Guild, which included many kinds of workmen,
ranging from carders of the rough material to dyers
and finers of the most costly fabrics. Thus, the guild
being able to carry on the manufacture in all its details,
and the different craftsmen required for the common end
being all bonded together, there was no fear that any one
branch of the trade would raise its prices to the detriment
of the rest. The emblem of the Wool Guild was a lamb
bearing a flag (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Agnus Dei</span></i>), while the Calimala showed a
red eagle on a white bale corded with many twists.</p>

<p>During the whole of the fourteenth and a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
part of the fifteenth century these two guilds continued to
progress, and maintained their supremacy in the markets
of Europe. Nevertheless, they were always in a difficult
position, since Italy could not supply them with sufficient
raw material, nor could they obtain the number of
hands required to carry on all the work connected with
their business. To establish branches of the trade in
neighbouring states and subject cities was an idea that
found no place in the economic and political theories of
the Middle Ages. In those days trade formed the chief
strength and social power of the communes: hence every
commune wished to have the monopoly of its advantages,
and the statutes bristled with decrees inspired by this
blindly jealous exclusiveness. For this reason, while
pursuing the system of keeping the finer and more profitable
processes of the manufacture in their own hands, the
Florentines had opened factories for the first and coarser
stages of the work in every place where the best wool could
be found, that is in Holland, Brabant, England, and France.
And even in these factories they took care that the more
difficult and profitable share of the process should be
done only by Florentine hands. Their chronicles prove
that they then spoke of foreigners in the same terms now
used by the latter with regard to ourselves: jeering at
the indolence and stupidity of the northerners, who even
on their own soil allowed strangers to snatch the bread from
their mouths. But this state of things could not last long.
From very early times the Flemings had always been a
strong, hard-working race, and were very soon equalled
by the French and English. So gradually the eyes of the
northerners were opened, and the Florentines saw new
factories rising abroad, side by side with and soon rivalling
their own, and were obliged to admit that, to their
own despite, they had taught foreigners the very trade of
which they had meant to preserve the monopoly. Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
was this the end of the matter. Being now on the alert,
the northerners tried to check the exportation of their
wools and of their uncut, or rather undressed, cloths; and
from the end of the fifteenth century Henry VII. of
England began to take measures to that effect. Thenceforth
the Guilds of Wool and Calimala were doomed to
decline in Florence. Fortunately, however, before this
came about, the silk trade had assumed the same importance
in Florentine commerce that was gradually
slipping away from the other two crafts.</p>

<p>As every one is aware, the art of silk-weaving, though
of very early origin in the East, was only introduced
much later to the Western world. The Romans obtained
a few silk stuffs from Persia, India, and China at an
enormous expense; they also had certain insects from
which material for highly esteemed fabrics was procured;
but until the closing years of the Middle Ages the real
silkworm was unknown in Italy, and the details of its first
introduction in the West have not yet been fully ascertained.
It is related that during the sixth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
two Persian monks concealed some silkworm seed inside
their staffs, and thus succeeded in bearing it to Constantinople,
where they taught the art of rearing the insects.
In this wise the silk trade is supposed to have been
originated in the dominions of the Byzantine Empire, and
carried thence by Arabs and Mahomedans to Sicily and
Greece. When Roger II., Count of Sicily, conquered
the Ionian islands, he returned to Palermo with
numerous prisoners (1147&ndash;48), who greatly assisted
the progress of the silk trade there. Thence it easily
penetrated to Lombardy and Tuscany; but was first
established and perfected in Lucca, all the Florentines
being still devoted to the profitable wool trade.</p>

<p>The consuls of the Silk Guild&mdash;or of Por' Santa Maria,
as it was designated in Florence, from the name of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
street&mdash;are mentioned among other guild-masters in
public treaties; but although this craft too may be of
ancient date, it certainly began to flourish much later
than the rest. Noting the fact that Giovanni Villani
makes no allusion to the Silk Guild in his very minute
account of Florentine trade and commerce in 1338, we
are inclined to believe that it had made very little advance
at that <span class="locked">period.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></span></p>

<p>We know that when Uguccioni della Faggiola besieged
and took Lucca (1314), fugitives from that city brought
their improved method of silk-weaving to Lombardy,
Venice, and Tuscany, and the art being particularly
undeveloped in Florence, many chroniclers gave the
Lucchese the credit of having first introduced it there.
Nevertheless, for many years afterwards the silk trade
was carried on by importing the raw material from the
East. But as the wool craft began to decline, Florence
gave its whole attention to silk, and the trade speedily began
to prosper. In the early years of the fifteenth century,
Gino Capponi&mdash;he who was commissary to the camp at
the siege of Pisa&mdash;taught the Florentines the art of
spinning the gold thread they had hitherto imported from
Cologne or from Cyprus to interweave with their silk.
This was the beginning of that delicate manufacture of
gold and silver brocades, in which by the combination of
technical skill with artistic sense, the Florentines soon
surpassed all rival manufacturers. The markets from
which their woollen stuffs had been ousted, were speedily
reconquered by their silken cloths and brocades. During
the latter half of the fifteenth century, in fact, we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
Benedetto Dei, a merchant of the Bardi Company, writing
a letter to Venice praising the glory and greatness of
Florentine commerce and saying: "We have two crafts
worthier and greater than any four contained in your city
of Venice." And the gist of his subsequent remarks was
to this effect: "Our woollen stuffs go to Rome, Naples,
Sicily, the Morea, Constantinople, Broussa, Pera, Gallipoli,
Schio, Rhodes, and Salonica. Then, as to the silk and
gold brocades, we produce more than Venice, Genoa, and
Lucca combined, and you see that we have houses, banks,
and warehouses at Lyons, Bruges, London, Antwerp,
Avignon, Geneva, Marseilles, and in <span class="locked">Provence."<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></span> This
long list of cities plainly shows that in Dei's time Florentine
woollens, though still prized in the East, had been
driven from the principal markets of the West, and
replaced by silk stuffs; and thus the two guilds shared
commerce between them, one in the East, the other in the
West. Also, according to Dei, Florence then possessed
eighty-three factories, where various tissues of silk, gold,
and silver were produced known by the names of damasks,
velvets, satins, taffetas, and <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">maremmati</span></i>, and most of the
raw silk used in their fabrication was still imported from
the East by Florentine <span class="locked">galleys.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></span></p>

<p>This is one of the trades longest preserved in Florence
and other parts of Italy, and to this day silk is among the
most important of our products. With this difference,
however, that whereas in past times the weaving of the
silk was our chief source of profit, at present we
frequently export the raw material, repurchasing at an
enormously increased price the fabrics returned to us
from foreign looms. In old times we imported woollen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
and silk yarn, and exported Italian cloth and brocade; in
these days, on the contrary, we send no small portion of
our raw silk to Lyons, and receive it back in a manufactured
state. In the same way other raw materials,
which we might easily work up ourselves, are despatched
to foreign factories.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>There was one branch of industry, however, almost
solely the product of human talent and energy, in which
the Florentines stood positively first. From the opening
of the thirteenth to the end of the fifteenth century the
money-changers' craft was an essentially Florentine business.
For as soon as the merchants had established commercial
relations with all the markets of the East and the
West, they naturally put into circulation a large quantity
of specie. Therefore it naturally ensued that if any
trader of Antwerp or Bruges wished to forward money to
Italy or Constantinople, the easiest and safest plan was to
apply to some of the Florentine merchants in his own
town. The latter bought up the wool and rough cloths,
which, after being dressed in Florence, either returned to
Northern Europe, or found their way to Constantinople,
Caffa, or Tana (Azov), in exchange for silks, dyes, and
spices. Accordingly the transmittal of any sum to any
part of the then known world cost them little more
trouble than the despatch of an ordinary letter, and was
always a source of gain. For they received <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">agio</span></i> on their
money, and by sending it in the form of merchandise,
reaped a second profit. When, on the contrary, any
Florentine wished to send a hundred florins to London,
he had only to walk a few steps to find some merchant
of the Calimala or Por' Santa Maria, who, by a line to his
correspondent in Lombard Street, caused the payment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
be made. These so-called letters of exchange (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lettere di
cambio</span></i>) proved one of the most useful of inventions for
the advancement of modern trade. There has been
much discussion as to whom this discovery was
originally owed. Some attribute it to the fugitive,
persecuted Jews in France and England; while others
ascribe it, at a much later date, to the Guelphs
banished from Florence in the thirteenth century. But
it is very difficult to ascertain who was the first author of
what cannot be justly styled a discovery, seeing that it is
an arrangement so readily occurring to the mind, that
examples of it are even to be found in very remote
antiquity. Besides, the real importance of the letter of
exchange consists not in its invention, but in its legally
authorised value, its extensive use, and the thousand
different ways in which it may be turned to account for
the speedy transmission and increase of capital. On these
points the Florentines of the period were altogether
unforestalled and unsurpassed, being superior masters
of the art of finance.</p>

<p>When the exiled Guelphs went wandering about the
world in the thirteenth century they strengthened the widespreading
commercial ties established by Florence, and
founding banks in all parts, gave a tremendous impulse
to the money-changers' trade. Accordingly they were
credited with the invention of the "letters of exchange,"
which now being widely circulated, gained added importance.
In fact, all subtle and ingenious devices for
multiplying gold, by despatching it to every market where,
being scarce, it consequently commanded the highest price
and interest, and almost all the complicated and difficult
operations practised by our modern bankers, were already
familiar to the Florentines. Whenever the Republic was
obliged to borrow money it obtained loans from the
bankers of Florence on precisely the same system and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
method in use at this day, no source of profit being
unknown to those financiers. Also, when the total of
these loans was formed into the so-called <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Monte Comune</span></i>,
paying interest on the consolidated capital, the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">luoghi del
Monte</span></i>, which would nowadays go by the name of "shares
of the public debt," were negotiated precisely as at
present. We find the Florentine merchants under the
Arcades of the New Market, speculating on the rise and
fall of stock, like modern men on "'Change" in great
<span class="locked">capitals.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></span> And the profits of similar ventures were far
greater at a time when lawful interest varied between 10
and 20 per cent., and few felt any scruples against
carrying it up to 40 per cent. by means of fictitious
contracts. For instance, the lenders would fix an impossibly
early date for the receipt of the lawful interest,
and after that date took 40 per cent. with the pretext
that the extra amount was the fine agreed upon in case
of non-payment.</p>

<p>It should be kept in mind that the Florentines reaped
great advantages in all these banking operations from the
excellent quality of their coinage, for the Republican Mint
always kept the best interests of commerce in view. To
this end, in the year 1252, the gold florin of twenty carats
was struck, with the figure of St. John on one side and the
lily of Florence on the reverse; and, owing to the goodness
of the metal and its alloy, soon obtained currency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
in every Eastern as well as European market. Eight of
these florins weighed one ounce, and a single florin was
valued at about twelve Italian <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>. The Florentines,
however, usually made their calculations in <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soldi</span></i>, and
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">denari</span></i>. The silver <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lira</span></i>, then the conventional standard,
consisted of twenty <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soldi</span></i>, and the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soldo</span></i> of twelve <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">denari</span></i>.
The florin seldom altered in value, but the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lira</span></i>, either
from the greater variability in the price of silver, or from
other causes, was constantly altering its rate with regard
to the florin. In 1252 the latter was equivalent to the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lira</span></i>, and therefore similarly divided into twenty <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soldi</span></i>;
in 1282 it already consisted of thirty-two <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soldi</span></i>; in 1331,
of sixty <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soldi</span></i>, or three <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>, and always changing in value,
rose to four <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>, eight <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soldi</span></i> by the year 1464.</p>

<p>The Florentines had discerned how greatly their commerce
was benefited by the use of a coin universally prized
in all markets supplied with their goods. But in the
beginning of the fifteenth century, when their trade
penetrated farther into the East, they found themselves
forestalled by the Venetians, whose gold ducat, somewhat
larger and heavier than the florin, was already current
there. Accordingly, in 1422, they decreed the issue of
another florin, equivalent to the Venetian ducat in weight,
size, and value, and therefore easily exchanged for it.
And as this new and larger florin was to be carried to the
Levant on board-ship, they named it the "broad florin,"
or the "galley florin," to distinguish it from the older
"sealed florin" (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">fiorino di suggello</span></i>). In 1471 the older
coin only was re-issued, and kept in circulation down to
1530, when it was held equivalent to seven <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>, and was
then withdrawn for a <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></span> Thus we see that for a
considerable period two different florins were in use, that
the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lira</span></i> altered in value from one year to another; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
if we likewise remember that economists are still unagreed
as to the exact difference between the present value of
gold and silver and their value in the days of the
Republic, we shall recognise the difficulty of making any
calculation sufficiently exact to afford any precise idea of
the relative prices of things. It is asserted by some
writers that a given quantity of gold was only worth in
those days double its present value; while others exaggerated
its value to fortyfold. Sismondi believes that in
the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries gold must have been
worth four times as much as at present. Certainly the
florin, or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">zechin</span></i>, as it was called later, is worth about
twelve Italian <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>. But the difference in the value of
gold remains involved in uncertainty. Besides, when old
writers reckon by <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>, it is needful to remember that these
coins varied in value; that it is impossible to make even
an approximative calculation without knowing the exact
date referred to.</p>

<p>Returning to the Guild of Changers, we must again
insist on the point that, in addition to the extended commercial
relations, the wise measures enforced by the
Republic and the singular activity of the citizens, the
rapid prosperity of the Florentine bankers was also greatly
enhanced by their nearness to Rome. The revenues of the
Holy See and of its prelates in all parts of Christendom
were all poured into the Eternal City. There gathered
the spiritual lords, bishops, and cardinals, holding rich
benefices in the East or the West; thither from all the
remotest ends of the known world believers sent sums of
"St. Peter's pence," together with the costly offerings
suited to a period of religious faith and fanaticism. The
keen-witted Florentines quickly recognised the advantage
of becoming bankers to the Pope; for thus the largest
floating capital in the world would have to pass through
their hands. So, from the first, they used the most persistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
efforts to obtain that position. If we find them
clinging to the Guelph cause through all changes of time
and circumstance, and preserving the name of Guelphs,
even when the term had lost all meaning, we must
attribute no little weight to commercial as well as to
political motives. Placed in the centre of Italy, and not
far from Rome, they had to struggle chiefly against the
Siennese, who were still nearer to the Eternal City. For
this reason we soon find them engaged in warfare and
jealous strife with Sienna, the which republic was subsequently
worsted, not only in fight, but also by the wider-stretching
enterprise of Florentine commerce. It is proved
by the correspondence of Gregory IX. that even in 1233
the Tuscans were forwarding remittances to the Pope
from various parts of the world; and gradually the
monopoly of this business became more exclusively concentrated
in Florentine hands. When the Pontifical Seat
was transferred from Rome to Avignon (1305), and on its
restoration later to Rome again, there occurred, twice at
least, an enormous displacement of interest, a great movement
of capital, and a necessity for large remittances in
cash; and, according to the best authorities, this was the
favourable moment when the Florentine contractors of the
Papal revenues were enabled to become the principal
bankers of Rome. From that time their fortune was
assured, the greatest banking business in Europe passed
through their hands, and they rose to so high a repute,
that all sought their help and advice on matters of finance.</p>

<p>We see the Florentines invited to manage the mints,
and fix the weights and measures of various European
states. In 1278 a convention between the King of
France and the Lombard and Tuscan <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Universitates</span></i> invites
both to find money for the former's government. In
1306 the Modenese people issued a decree, appealing for
the same purpose, to the notaries and bankers of Florence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Then in 1302, when the King of France, lacking funds
wherewith to make war, decided on repeated debasement
of the coinage, this fatal step was attributed to the
advice of two Florentines, Bicci and Musciatto Franzesi.
These men were severely censured by their fellow-citizens,
many of whom had been ruined by the bad French currency.
On all occasions when the French sovereigns were
on the eve of a great war, they were practically compelled
to first secure the aid of some known Florentine banker
in bearing the expense. Some of these bankers held the
same position in Europe as the Rothschilds of the present
day, and accumulated fortunes of apparently fabulous
amounts. In 1260 the Salimbeni house lent twenty
thousand florins to the Siennese. In 1338 we find the
Bardi and Peruzzi creditors of King Edward III. of
England for one million three hundred and sixty-five
florins, the which, without reckoning the difference in the
value of gold, would amount to about sixteen millions of
Italian <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>; and allowing for that difference, would
amount, as Sismondi has calculated, to no less than sixty-four
millions. Pagnini adds a list of many other loans,
amounting to a positively enormous total. In 1321
the Peruzzi had a credit of 191,000 florins on the
Order of Jerusalem alone, and the Bardi another of
133,000 florins. In 1348 the house of Tommaso di
Carroccio degli Alberti and his kinsmen had banks at
Avignon, Brussells, Paris, Sienna, Perugia, Rome, Naples,
Barletta, Constantinople, and <span class="locked">Venice.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></span> And at the close of
the fifteenth century Philippe de Commines declared that
Edward IV. of England owed his crown to the help of
Florentine bankers.</p>

<p>The Money-changers' Guild was one of the oldest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Florence, its consuls being named on the same footing as
the rest in all public records; and a copy of its statutes,
dated 1299 (1300 new style), makes reference to an earlier
code of 1280, that was not the earliest of all. This craft
prospered and waned with the commerce of Florence. It
was carried on in the New Market, where it had shops with
counters or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">tavoletti</span></i>, money-bags, and ledgers. All business
had to be performed in the shop, and registered in
the account book, and heavy penalties were exacted for
any infringement of the rule; nor was any one allowed
to exercise the craft without being inscribed on the matriculation
list, a privilege only to be obtained by having
given proofs of capacity and honesty during matriculation,
and sworn to obey the statutes of the guild. In 1338
there were about eighty of these money-changers' stalls,
and Florence coined from 350,000 to 400,000 gold
<span class="locked">florins.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></span> In 1422 these stalls numbered seventy-two,
while it was calculated that Florence had a capital of two
million florins in circulation, without including the value
of the merchandise in the <span class="locked">city.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></span> In 1472, partly because
the first signs of the decline of trade were appearing, and
partly because trade was becoming restricted to a more
and more limited number of firms, the banks were already
reduced to <span class="locked">thirty-three,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></span> although the chronicler Benedetto
Dei still remarked with pride that these bankers did business
in the East and the West, "as is well known to the
Venetians and Genoese, and likewise to the Court of
<span class="locked">Rome."<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></span> They were everywhere known by the names
of changers, lenders, usurers, Tuscans, and Lombards, and,
together with other Italian houses, had a street of their
own both in London and Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>In order to complete the list of the greater guilds,
we must say a few words concerning the Doctors and
Druggists, and Skinners and Furriers, and particularly the
former. Although of less importance commercially than
the guilds already described, they had a great share in
promoting Florentine trade in the Levant, whence nearly
all drugs and spices were received in exchange, and no
less than twenty-two different qualities of fur, many of
which, being the skins of rare animals, formed some
of the dearest articles of luxury. Therefore these two
guilds likewise rose to great influence, inasmuch as the
Eastern trade has invariably proved the main source of
wealth for all nations, and most of all for Italy. It
served to sustain the high fortunes of Venice; it had
enriched Amalfi, Genoa, and Pisa; and accordingly was
constantly coveted by the Florentines, whose highest
prosperity indeed was only attained when the Black Sea
being opened to their galleys, they could enjoy the same
rights as the Venetians in Egypt, Constantinople, and
the Crimea. This, so long their principal aim, was
not, however, quickly attained: they continued to
wrestle for it throughout almost the whole of the
fourteenth century.</p>

<p>The struggles maintained by the Florentines for the
extension of their trade play a very important part in
the history of the Republic, not only demonstrating
the progress of their wealth, but likewise the ruling
motives of their policy. In fact, the moment they had
won their first successes against the nobles of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>
surrounding them on all sides, they immediately tried to
monopolise the whole trade with Lombardy. One of the
first treaties signed by them was with the Ubaldini, lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
of the Mugello, for the purpose of opening that highway
for their products; and shortly afterwards they made a
treaty with the Bölognese (1203). But in course of
time the latter, profiting by their position, exacted
heavier tolls on the merchandise now continually passing
through their territory; whereupon the Florentines
promptly came to terms with Modena, opening a fresh
road for their commerce, and thus compelling Bölogna
to respect the original agreement. In 1282, at the time
of the war against Pisa, they arranged treaties guaranteeing
free passage to their merchandise through Lucca,
Prato, Pistoia, and Volterra, and thus began their
domination over the commerce of Tuscany. Nearly all
their wars were undertaken for purposes of trade, and
ended with trading agreements. In 1390 they entered
into conventions with Faenza and Ravenna, and then
step by step with the majority of the Italian cities.</p>

<p>The continual increase of Florentine commerce by
land made the necessity of free access to the sea ever
more pressing and indispensable. But to reach either
Porto Pisano or Leghorn, the only ports convenient for
their trade, they must necessarily traverse the republic of
Pisa, their powerful neighbour and rival. For if the
Florentines were masters of nearly the whole Tuscan
trade by land, the Pisans were lords of the sea, and had
no intention of allowing their realm to be snatched from
them by so industrious and energetic a race as their
competing neighbours. Accordingly the Pisans had only
to demand heavy tolls for the passage of those neighbours'
goods, and the Florentines were left with no remedy save
recourse to arms. Hence the continual warfare and
perpetual rivalry of the two republics. After the capture
of Volterra by the Florentines in 1254, the threatening
attitude of their victorious troops drove the Pisans to
grant free passage to their merchandise, and in 1273,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
1293, 1327, and 1329 similarly compelled them to
adhere to the same terms. Pisa, however, never yielded
the point with a good grace, but merely to avoid war, or
in consequence of defeat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Florentines were continually extending
their trade to remoter parts of the East, and concluding
fresh treaties there. This, while increasing their desire
to command the sea, fanned the jealousy of Pisa to a
fiercer flame. In Pagnini's work on "La Decima" we
find an essay on the "Practise of Trade" ("Pratica
della Mercatura"), written early in the fourteenth century
by an agent of the Bardi firm, one Balducci Pegolotti.
Next to Marco Polo's "Milione," this work is one of
our most important sources of information regarding
Italian travels and trading enterprises in the Levant, and
furnishes specially minute details of Florentine traffic.
From what Pegolotti tells us of his own doings, we may
judge what was done by his fellow-citizens in general.
In 1315 he succeeded in securing for them in Antwerp
and Brabant similar franchises to those already enjoyed
by the Genoese, Germans, and English. He afterwards
went to the Levant, and found at Cyprus that the Bardi
and Peruzzi alone shared the privilege granted to the
Pisans of only paying 2 per cent. import and export
duty; whereas all other Florentines had either to pay
4 per cent., or feign to be Pisans, a device exposing
them to many spiteful reprisals from the latter, who
treated them <i>worse than slaves or Jews</i>. These proceedings
aroused Pegolotti's wrath, so that, although he
was one of the Bardi firm, he made great and successful
efforts to have the same privilege of franchise extended
to the rest of the Florentines (1324). Thus, their
common interests being promoted no less by the energy
of individuals than by that of their government, these
merchants continued to make advance in the East, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
stir the Pisans to greater envy. In fact, the latter decided
in 1343 to reduce the exemptions allowed on Florentine
merchandise, decreeing that goods only to the value of
200,000 florins might pass untaxed through their city;
all the rest being charged two <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soldi</span></i> the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lira</span></i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, at the
rate of 10 per cent. This left the Florentines no choice
save to make war, or find some mode of avoiding the
Pisan highway. To prove that their trade was not
altogether at the mercy of Pisa, they preferred the second
alternative. By making treaty with the Siennese, they
obtained the concession of Porto Talamone, and at great
expense, and in the teeth of many difficulties, finally
succeeded in making it a vast emporium for their wares.
The road to Talamone was long and inconvenient; but
the Pisans, soon perceiving that they had done greater
damage to themselves than to Florence, and that although
they might inflict annoyance on the latter, there was no
hope of destroying its trade, were therefore presently
reduced to permit the free passage of merchandise.
Accordingly the Florentines felt braced to more extensive
enterprise in the <span class="locked">Levant.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptian route was the easiest and most direct
for trading purposes; but sultan and califs barred the
road to Christians. The Venetians alone, from having
concluded treaties, it was said, "in the holy name of
God and Mahomet," had made some way in that country
to the jealous exclusion of all other Italians, who therefore
usually travelled by Constantinople and the Black Sea,
where they, and more especially the Genoese, had founded
some populous and flourishing cities. Farther on, by the
Sea of Azoff, a mile or so from the mouth of the Don,
stood the town of Tana (Azov), a great business centre
for traders from Russia, Arabia, Persia, Armenia, Mogul,
and Southern China; and the chief place of exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
for Eastern and Western products. The Italians brought
silk or woollen fabrics, oil, wine, pitch, tar, and common
metals, and bartered them for precious stones, pearls,
gold, spices, sweetmeats, sugar, Eastern tissues of silk,
wool, or cotton, raw silk, goatskins, dye-woods, and
likewise for Eastern slaves of either sex, who were to be
seen in Italy down to the end of the fifteenth <span class="locked">century.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></span>
All this varied commerce, originally started by Amalfi
and other southern states, was afterwards carried on by
the Venetians, Genoese, and Pisans. The argosies of
those republics traversed all parts of the Archipelago,
the Bosphorus, and the Black Sea. Italian was spoken
in all the harbours of the East, where, besides Italian
banks, workshops, and factories, there were cities founded
and inhabited solely by Italians, with buildings in the
Genoese or Venetian style, but where Italian, and especially
Venetian, architecture became modified by Oriental
influences. A great number of Genoese were settled in
those parts. To give some idea of the naval strength of
Venice, it will be enough to say that during the Crusade
of 1202 that Republic equipped a fleet able to convey
4,500 horsemen, 9,000 squires, 30,000 infantry, and
stores for nine months. Their galleys, never less than
80 feet in length, sometimes measured 110 by 70 in
width, and in the fifteenth century were forty-five in
number, with a total of 11,000 seamen. At the same
time they also possessed 3,000 other vessels of from ten
to one hundred tons, with 17,000 men, and 300 big
ships with 8,000 men. In all, therefore, 3,345 vessels,
with 36,000 <span class="locked">seamen,<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></span> a strength that seems positively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
incredible, when we remember that the 'Serenissima' Republic
of Venice was a city built on the sandbanks of
the lagoons; that the entire management of its policy
and trade was in the hands of men born within the narrow
bounds of those lagoons. Accordingly we may imagine
how great was the united strength of all the maritime
republics, and how signal the courage of the Florentines
in competing with them so obstinately for the Levantine
trade.</p>

<p>Before launching a single galley, the Florentines had
already established many houses and banks in every place,
and contrived to introduce their merchandise in all the
principal Eastern ports. We not only find them doing
a vast business at Tana with great energy and enterprise,
but also pushing on thence to far remoter regions.
Pegolotti minutely describes the route followed by them,
their manner of travelling, and the time employed in it.
They journeyed, he tells us, through Astracan (Gittarchan),
to Saracanco (Sarai) on the Volga, thence by
Organci in <span class="locked">Zagataio,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a></span> not far from the Caspian Sea, and
crossing Asia by many places of which the names cannot
be identified with any known at this day, they penetrated
as far as Gambaluc, or Gamulecco, the chief city of China,
that is to say, the city of Pekin. They employed eight
or ten months to go from Tana to Pekin. Thus a period
of almost two years was required for the journey there
and back and time of sojourn, and when we also calculate
the voyage from Porto Pisano or Leghorn to Tana and
back, it is plain that a Florentine bound for Pekin could
rarely count on returning home within three <span class="locked">years.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
During the growth of this Eastern trade, carried on
with such indomitable energy, amid difficulties of all
kinds, the Florentines were always aiming at the command
of the seaboard, and never losing sight of the
necessity of having a port of their own. And when, by
the capture of Pisa in 1406, that long-desired object was
finally attained, a new era began for their commerce. All
their business concerns became most rapidly extended, and
the first half of the fifteenth century was the time in
which their greatest wealth was accumulated. In 1421
they appointed "consuls of the sea," who were ordered to
immediately build two wide-beamed merchant galleons
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">galee di mercato</span></i>) and six narrow galleys, and to continue
to launch one of either kind every six months, for the
which purpose a monthly sum of one hundred florins was
assigned from the revenues of the Pisan university.
Accordingly Florence soon possessed a merchant fleet of
eleven stout galleons and fifteen narrow galleys continually
employed in the Eastern traffic by command of the
Republic. All these vessels had strict sailing orders as to
the course to be taken, the ports to be touched at, and the
freight to be carried. Announcements of their departure
and arrival were hung in the arcades of the New Market;
and the vessels being chartered by private individuals, the
government was enabled to keep the Eastern routes open
to all, without any outlay. In 1422, when, as already
related, the "galley florin" was coined, the Florentines, at
the instance of one Taddeo Cenni, a merchant long established
in Venice, despatched two envoys to Egypt to
obtain the right of having a church, warehouses, dockmen,
and porters of their own at Alexandria. The negotiation
proving successful, in 1423 they instructed the "consuls
of the sea" to appoint extra consuls at every port where
their presence might be useful to Florentine trade. Some
had been established for more or less time at Constantinople,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Pera (1339), and London (1402); but from this
moment we find them at Alexandria, Majorca, Naples,
and other ports in all directions. These consuls had offices
and clerks of their own, interpreters, men-at-arms, and
places of worship; and all their expenses, salary included,
were deducted from the freight dues received by <span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></span></p>

<p>To fully understand to what extent and in what way
the Florentines profited by the new conditions resulting
from their conquest of Pisa, it is necessary to point out
that this event not only marks the time of their highest
commercial prosperity, and the beginning of their navy
and merchant fleet, but also indicates the date of their
first attention to nautical and astronomical studies. We
gain another proof of their great intelligence and untiring
activity when we see that their first efforts in a branch of
learning of which they had no previous knowledge enabled
them to initiate the era of scientific triumphs, opening
with Paolo Toscanelli, the first inspirer of Christopher
Columbus, continued by Amerigo Vespucci, and closing
with Galileo Galilei and his imperishable school.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The seven guilds, already described by us, were styled
the greater guilds, as being those of most importance and
having the chief trade and wealth of the State in their
hands. Several of these guilds consisted, as we have seen,
rather of different crafts banded together, than of a single
branch of industry; they gave employment to many
workers, gathered and made use of enormous funds. But
Florence also possessed the so-called lesser guilds numbering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
fourteen in all, namely: Linenmakers and Mercers,
Shoemakers, Smiths, Salters, Butchers and Slaughterers,
Wine-dealers, Innkeepers, Harnessmakers, Leatherdressers,
Armourers, Ironmongers, Masons, Carpenters, <span class="locked">Bakers.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></span></p>

<p>Certain smaller Florentine crafts had also obtained great
repute in Italy: for instance, that of the wood and stone
carvers, who were esteemed as some of the best in the
world. In all work demanding any share of artistic ability
the Tuscans stood unrivalled. Thus the Florentine
moulders of waxen images were considered to have
incomparable skill, and we even find this remarked by the
chronicler Dei. But neither the carvers nor the wax
moulders formed an association, and were artists rather
than artizans. But, leaving this question aside, the lesser
guilds, although numerous and energetic, failed to achieve
any noteworthy influence. Their difference from the
greater guilds mainly lay in the fact that, being solely
concerned with the local trade of the Republic, they were
confined to a very limited field of business and enterprise,
while the others engaged in the trade with the East and
the West, were enabled to attain a high position even in
politics, and to finally become masters of the State.</p>

<p>Looking back on the period in which the greater guilds
rose to power, we shall see that they simultaneously held
in their grasp the commerce, wealth, and government of
the Florentine Republic. We shall also readily understand
the enormous energy they must have displayed in
order to use politics as a means for increasing the
opulence that, in the existing conditions of Italy, had
become the chief strength of our communes. The
Florentine merchants, having long divined that the future
would belong to them, were always the firmest supporters
of the Guelph party against the Imperial Ghibellinism of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
the nobles and had vowed eternal hatred to the latter.
We may now imagine Florence as a huge house of
business, situated in the centre of Tuscany, and surrounded
by others all competing with it in the race for
success. International law and equity were unknown to
the Middle Ages: hence when any State felt envious of
its neighbour, the obvious course to adopt was to prohibit
that neighbour from traversing its territory, and exact
unbearably heavy dues from the rival it feared. Accordingly,
the Republic of Florence, being the object of still
fiercer jealousy on account of the continual increase of its
commerce, and lacking room to breathe, as it were,
without access to the sea, would have been speedily
reduced to impotence had it not resisted its neighbours by
force of arms. Hence, the necessity of defending its
existence involved the State in an uninterrupted series of
wars, invariably terminated by treaties of commerce, in
which the unfailing subtlety of the Florentines always
won the advantage.</p>

<p>We have seen from the beginning how Florence combated
the neighbouring barons in order to secure the
progress of its dawning trade, and subsequently obtained
a passage through the Mugello for its increased traffic
with Romagna and Lombardy. Later on, we have seen it
engaged in fiercer struggles, and, after many vicissitudes,
subduing almost all the Ghibelline cities of Tuscany, as,
for instance, Volterra, Sienna, and Arezzo. And when
inquiring why Florence should have remained so obstinately
Guelph, even in the face of Papal threats, and
repeating the same question Farinata put to <span class="locked">Dante&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span></p>

</div>

<p class="in0">the invariable reply has been that in addition to political
motives of a more general nature, it must be kept in mind
that the plutocracy now risen to power had first attained
wealth by doing its chief business with Rome. Sienna,
Arezzo, and Volterra being on the road and closer to
Rome, were doomed to defeat in any competition with
Florence.</p>

<p>Then, as soon as the Republic had secured its hold on
Roman affairs and the Lombard trade, we saw its
irresistible need of access to the sea, and that a war of
extermination with Pisa had become altogether inevitable.
To suppose that this prolonged, constantly renewed and
sanguinary conflict was solely caused by a blind instinctive
hatred of Pisa, when other and more serious reasons were
so plainly existent, would be to deny the evidence of facts.
From beginning to end it was simply the clash of violently
opposed interests. The Pisans were perfectly aware that
to yield a free passage to the power already commanding the
chief trade in the interior of Italy&mdash;the power that, without
having as yet a single galley afloat, had already made its
way to all the harbours of the East&mdash;the power so persistently
struggling for absolute supremacy in Tuscany&mdash;could
only lead to their own lasting subjection. Therefore
they resisted to the utmost of their strength. Their
resources were undoubtedly great, and as many other
Italians were equally hostile to the supremacy of Florence,
the latter could never have succeeded in reducing the
Pisans, had it not constantly employed the shrewdest
devices in addition to its efforts in the field. In fact there
is no better proof of the political ability of the Florentines
than their mode of conducting this war and the means
they employed to attain the object that, throughout the
whole course of their history, had been their chief and invariable
aim. We find them steadfast in their friendship
to Lucca, and always prompt to succour that city at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
costs, because Lucca was never well disposed to the Pisans,
and might prove a most useful ally in any campaign
against them. So, too, we always find Florence on good
terms with Genoa, and avoiding every risk of giving
offence to a power that was Pisa's natural rival on the seas.
Indeed, the Florentines always did their best to foster that
rivalry, inasmuch as without an ally strong enough to
assist them by crushing Pisa's power by sea, they could
never hope to overthrow it by land. And at last the Pisans
were defeated by the Genoese in the naval battle of
Meloria (August 6, 1284). From that day the conquest
of Pisa by the Florentines, although still to be long contested,
was a foregone conclusion, and from that moment
also their friendship for the Genoese began to lose warmth.
While desiring assistance in overcoming Pisa, they wished
to avoid aggrandising the power of a Ghibelline republic,
already very mighty on the sea. Accordingly, after
having so furiously attacked and enfeebled Pisa, we find
them aiding that state to withstand the Genoese, until the
moment came when the latter having abandoned the idea
of conquering Pisa, they could successfully undertake its
conquest on their own account.</p>

<p>With equal sagacity they pursued the same course in
the years during which they were menaced by the powerful
Dukes of Milan who sought to become masters of
all Italy, and also when threatened from the south by the
enmity of King Ladislaus of Naples. The art of stirring
division among their foes, of supporting the weaker party
against overbearing neighbours, of constantly contriving
to rouse half Italy against every potentate risen to
sufficient strength to be a terror to their own Republic,
was the invariable means by which Florence maintained
her independence in the midst of States who were losing
their liberty, and in the midst of the numerous and
formidable foes pressing about her on all sides. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
this successful policy was the work of the greater guilds,
or rather of the prosperous trading class (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani grassi</span></i>).</p>

<p>These mercantile aristocrats ruled the Republic with
so much energy and zeal, precisely because the aggrandisement
of Florence conduced at the same time to the
increase of their own wealth and commerce. Thus a city
whose population was seldom more than 100,000, and
often shrank far below that number, and whose narrow
territory was surrounded by so many enemies, was enabled
to become a State feared by the rest of Italy, and respected
throughout Europe. These Florentine merchants were so
jealous of their liberty as to deem no sacrifice too vast for
its preservation, and were neither bewildered nor daunted
by any danger, even when their trade was at stake. In
fact, although so obstinately Guelph, and connected with
Rome by so many commercial interests and ties, we find
them ready to combat the Pope himself, when he made
attacks on their liberty, and see them giving the name
of the <i>Eight Saints</i> to the magistrates charged to conduct
the campaign against Gregory XI. (1376). In the
like manner we find them carrying on a war with the
Visconti of Milan at a yearly cost of millions of florins,
without the resources of the Republic being exhausted, or
the courage of its rulers worn out.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, it would be an error to suppose that the
domination of the greater guilds was assured and uncontested
in the interior, at least, of the city. On the day
when the scheme was first mooted, in the Calimala court,
of placing these guilds at the head of the government,
they speedily recognised that the possibility of success
was solely owed to the fact of their having fought and
conquered the nobles with the help of the lesser arts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Hence, on the one hand, they had to face their natural
and inveterate foes, the survivors of the feudal order,
and on the other the lesser guilds coveting a share in the
government which they had helped to establish. Thus
the Republic comprised three classes of citizens and three
separate parties. It is true that the greater guilds constituted
by far the stronger of the three factions, but the
others might become, if united, a very formidable opposition.
And their union was no impossible contingency.</p>

<p>The difference, in fact, between the greater and lesser
guilds was not merely one of degree as regarded their
respective wealth and power; what divided them was the
diversity of interests urging them to pursue an opposite
policy. The wool-dresser or silk merchant was always
ready to sacrifice his last florin, provided the Republic
could gain possession of Leghorn or Porto Pisano. Accordingly
he invariably kept a strict watch on the policy of
Lucca and Genoa, to prevent them from making friendly
advances to the Pisans. The Florentine banker was
anxious that his Republic should always possess skilful
ambassadors and consuls, able to supply full details of all
that occurred in Rome, Antwerp, or Caffa, and impede
the Siennese, Genoese, Venetians, and Lombards from
gaining too much influence in those cities. Where any
question of this kind was concerned the members of the
greater guilds were always disposed to promote hostilities,
no matter how prolonged, expensive, or dangerous, and
to subject both themselves and the State to unlimited
sacrifices. But financial and political interests weighed
little with the blacksmiths, masons, carpenters, and other
members of the fourteen lesser guilds, which nevertheless
formed so considerable a part of the Florentine population.
It mattered far more to them that Florence should
be inhabited by rich and splendid gentry; that sumptuous
palaces, villas, and monumental churches should have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
be built; that there should be a continual increase of
luxury and good living among the citizens of rank and
wealth, by whom they earned their subsistence. Warfare,
on the contrary, put a check upon luxury, and the greater
guilds were always issuing decrees against it, precisely on
account of the exigences of the wars they so constantly had
on hand. Hence the poorer classes detested the opulent
burghers, whom they had helped to raise to power, who
had subsequently excluded them, as well as the nobles,
from the government, and who, while accumulating untold
millions, often lived in the city on a footing of Spartan
frugality; the men daily promulgating new edicts
against female luxury in dress; forbidding the use of
gold and silver ornaments, prohibiting all lavish expenditure
for entertainments or wedding banquets, even going so far
as to limit the number and choice of viands, and exclude
gold and silver plate from festive tables; but who, nevertheless,
were always very ready to squander millions in
attacks on the Pisans, the King of Naples, the Visconti of
Milan, or even for a church, or an additional consul
at Caffa or Pera. This difference of temper generated
party hatred. Nor should it be omitted that some of the
bitterest outcries against the greater guilds came from
the women of Florence, who, being naturally opposed to
warfare, and addicted to extravagance, objected to the
vexatious restrictions imposed by law, while yet contriving
to evade them with indescribable <span class="locked">ingenuity.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
It is very easy to realise how good an opportunity this
afforded the nobles of gaining the favour of the populace
by stirring these germs of discord. They exercised no
trade, lived on their revenues, but spent freely and lavishly
in Florence. Accordingly, whenever engaged in fresh
attempts to seize the government, or preserve their
remaining share in it, they always allied themselves with
the mob that lived&mdash;or at least believed itself to live&mdash;solely
at their expense, and roused its resentment against
the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani grassi</span></i>&mdash;or well-to-do burghers&mdash;by dwelling
on the fact that whereas all the guilds were equally engaged
in trade and commerce, a considerable number of them
had no share in the power exclusively monopolised by the
rest. The democratic spirit was far too lively in Florence
for these devices to assure the safety of the nobles, much
less their return to power; but they had the effect of
stirring the masses to a burning and irresistible thirst for
power, and of awakening revolutionary passions in the
mob. Thus, at the moment of finally losing their old
supremacy in the city, the nobles achieved the revenge
of bequeathing to Florence a prolonged inheritance of
strife that kept the Republic divided, and hastened its
fall.</p>

<p>In fact, when at last the lesser guilds obtained a share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
in the government, they were never at one with the
greater trades. Their hostility was continually shown
in all councils, tribunals, and public gatherings; and
they sometimes resorted to the perilous means of inflaming
the worst passions of the mob which, as usual,
served as a ready tool for ambitious aims. In this way
a spirit of anarchy was unloosed, leading first to the
revolt of the Ciompi, then to the necessity of seeking a
protector for the Republic, and finally to the rule of the
Medici. But before arriving at these extremities, there
were two centuries of struggle, during which Florentine
affairs were almost invariably in the hands of the
burghers. On several occasions the reins of power
seemed to have slipped from their grasp, but they always
managed to retain enough influence to secure the election
of magistrates of their own choice. In this way victory
was restored to them, and they again took possession of
the government. When, on the other hand, the triumph
of anarchy made it requisite to seek a protector, and this
protector, summoned to the defence of the Republic,
sided with the malcontents and tried to establish a
tyranny, the burghers then contrived to unite every
faction in the interest of their common freedom and
reinstate the Republican government, thus giving it a
fresh lease of life. By dint of incredible sagacity, daring,
and steadfastness, they managed to struggle on amid a
thousand dangers, both within and without the walls.
Although plunged in perpetual conflict with those who
desired peace and claimed ever wider rights; although
surrounded by most powerful external foes now attempting
to destroy their trade, now their Republic, their energy
and patriotism never wearied, never failed to be on the
alert. It was a feverish time of unceasing stress and
strain, and freedom, though always on the verge of
annihilation, was kept alive for two centuries in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
of communities where it was perishing. And even as the
burghers had managed to create all sorts of financial
combinations for the increase of trade and multiplication
of wealth, so they showed inexhaustible ingenuity in
devising new schemes and institutions to prolong the life
of their Republic.</p>

<p>In matters of foreign policy Florentine diplomats
became so renowned for sagacity and quick-wittedness,
that on certain points they enjoyed even higher repute
than the famed ambassadors of Venice. The latter, in
fact, with their old traditions of statecraft, pursued the
invariable policy of a strong, calm and self-reliant government.
Their strength was the outcome of the strength
and wisdom of a republic commanding both fear and
respect, and whose voice seemed to be heard in the speech
of its envoys. Every Florentine ambassador exercised,
on the contrary, a direct personal influence, due to his
own sharpness of intellect, extraordinary knowledge of
mankind, and marvellous aptitude for comprehending
everything and making everything clearly understood.
Undoubtedly the State acted in him and by him; but
less because he served as its mouthpiece than because
it had succeeded in evoking and training all his mental
powers and rendering him an intelligent and independent
personality. Florentine merchants, notaries, administrators,
and diplomats were universally prized, and seemed
at home in every corner of the globe. Hence it is said
that one day Pope Boniface VIII., seeing that the
ambassadors sent to him from different parts of the world
were one and all Florentines, quietly remarked, "You
Florentines are the fifth element in creation."</p>

<p>It was in the midst of these political conflicts, of this
ferment of the human mind, that art and literature rose
to such splendour, that the whole world was, as it were,
illuminated by the radiance shed by Italian cities, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
shining most brightly from Florence. The far-reaching
energy of this city of commerce and trade was felt almost
everywhere; but even at points where this had failed to
penetrate, the genius of Florentine literature and art
seems to have asserted its power and initiated modern
culture in Europe.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>All this, however, was carried on in the face of continual
and new dangers, threatening the very life of the
Republic, and sometimes only to be averted by super-human
efforts. Memory instinctively carries us back to
the Florence of old with its council and its Consuls, yearly
taking the field united and agreed, for the purpose of
abasing the nobles and clearing the highways for the
march of its trade; and then, having reduced the hostile
barons one by one, compelling them to live within the
walls, subject to the equal pressure of republican laws;&mdash;to
the times when the State could only overcome its more
powerful neighbours by emancipating the slaves of the
soil and granting political privileges to traders hitherto
unpossessed of any such rights. On recalling those times,
we easily recognise that they contained the germs of future
greatness for the Commune that by dint of continual
warfare succeeded in augmenting its resources in every
direction. Later, however, things were radically changed,
owing to many causes, and above all in consequence of
the new method of warfare to which we have already
alluded and which must now be more fully described.</p>

<p>Down to the fourteenth century republican armies
were composed of foot soldiers, lightly equipped with
sword, shield, and helmet, and some slight defensive
armour for leg or breast. The horse were few in number
and never decided the fate of a battle. All barbarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
armies had been composed much on the same plan,
excepting those of the Huns and Moors, who were almost
always mounted, and of the Byzantines, whose cavalry
had frequently defeated the Goths. Frederic Barbarossa's
Italian campaigns had been chiefly carried on
by infantry and withstood by the infantry of our
communes, who could then turn all able-bodied
citizens into soldiers at a moment's notice. But in
the campaigns of Frederic II., Manfred and Charles of
Anjou, a new method of war had been imported into
Italy from Germany and France. The Florentines had
learnt this to their cost at the battle of Montaperti, when
their numerous army was routed by the charge of a few
German horse. From that moment the issue of all Italian
battles began to be decided by heavy cavalry or by men-at-arms.
The mounted soldier was clad in steel from
head to foot, although not yet, as at the close of the
fifteenth century, encased, together with his steed, in such
ponderous armour, that, once fallen, neither could rise
from the ground without help. Armed with a very long
lance, the horseman could overthrow the foot soldier
before the latter could approach him with his short sword.
Besides, this weapon never served to pierce the armour
either of man or horse; and the arrows of the bowmen
were equally useless. Accordingly, a few hundred men-at-arms
pushed forward like a movable and impregnable
fortress into the midst of a host of infantry sufficed to
rout it in a very short time. This state of things lasted
until the invention of powder and firearms produced a
radical change in the condition of the Italian communes.
For mounted troops required much training and great
expenditure. It was not enough to maintain great
arsenals, to create and train a new breed of horses, but
every trooper had also to be kept in steady practice, devote
his whole time to warfare, and keep two or three squires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
continuously drilled and employed. These squires carried
all the armour and weapons and led the knight's charger,
which was only used in battle. Only then, too, were
knight and steed in full harness, otherwise both would
have been exhausted in the hour of danger. Hence
it was impossible for our republics to raise cavalry, seeing
that citizens, earning their living by trade and commerce,
could not forsake their daily work to acquire the art of
war. Therefore, soldiering became a regular trade, and
all choosing it for their career speedily began to put a
price on their swords. Thus from the closing years of
the thirteenth century we begin to find <i>soldiers</i> of various
nationalities&mdash;Catalans, Burgundians, Germans, and other
foreign horse&mdash;in the ranks of republican armies, and the
number of these mercenaries was continually on the
increase.</p>

<p>Gradually, also, tradesmen were obliged to recognise
that they had become personally useless in the field.
Accordingly, whenever the republics were threatened with
attack, they no longer ventured to give battle without
hiring some captain with a band of foreign horse. Italian
valour rapidly lost its prestige, and "Companies of
Adventure"&mdash;soon to be the cause of our direst calamities&mdash;began
to be formed. Later on, it is true that when
Alberico da Barbiano, Attendolo Sforza, Braccio da
Montone, and others adopted the same career, they
rivalled and even surpassed the foreign adventurers, who
had now often to yield the palm to Italian courage.
Soon, in fact, many came from afar to learn the new
art of war under these Italian captains whose skill first
reduced it to a science. Nevertheless, few citizens of
free states were able to devote their whole life to war.
It was the nobles, the exiles, the unemployed&mdash;knowing
no other trade&mdash;and the subjects of petty tyrants who
joined the "Companies of Adventure." And whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
small bands or large, Italian or foreign, they invariably
hastened the ruin of all our communes, and more
especially of Florence. The continual wars in which
this State was now engaged no longer served to foster the
military spirit and energy of its people. Always compelled
to rely on the help of foreign mercenaries, it soon
lost all confidence in its own resources, the which therefore
rapidly declined. A campaign simply implied some
financial operation, or the levying of fresh taxes to
furnish sufficient capital for the hire of one of the
captains of adventure, who always closed with the highest
bid. The money found, it was often enough to send it
to the State's surest and most powerful ally, who undertook
to complete the affair by engaging the captain best
able to hire the largest number of men. So the chief
thing was to know how to gain friends and excite enemies
against the foe, and in this the Florentines always showed
masterly skill. But these devices were no proof of
military capacity. The most important personages despatched
by them to the seat of war were commissioners
charged to superintend the general proceedings, the
administration of the army, and the political object of
the campaign, and although we sometimes find these
commissioners suddenly transformed into captains, taking
command of the forces and deciding the fate of a battle
with singular daring, their functions were always civil
and diplomatic rather than military.</p>

<p>It is easy to foresee the final results of this method
with regard to the future of the Republic, and the morals
of its inhabitants. The stout burghers at the head of
the government were engaged in the continual practice
of cunning and craft. It was requisite to show adroitness
in the council chamber; to thwart the nobles; to remain
constantly on the alert to prevent the populace from
growing unruly, while persuading it to furnish funds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
carry on wars which were indispensable to secure the
safety and prosperity of the foreign trade. Hence, still
greater subtlety was needed in diplomatic negotiations to
avoid being isolated, and to continually maintain the
equilibrium of Italian States in the way most advantageous
for the Republic. Even actual warfare being now reduced,
as we have seen, to a financial operation, had come
to be a fresh proof of ingenuity. There were no longer
any of those vast sacrifices of citizens' blood and citizens'
lives which serve towards the continued regeneration
of a people, no longer any deeds of open and generous
violence. And at times when the rich burghers were not
absorbed in politics, they and all the rest of the citizens
were devoted heart and soul to commerce, employing
their leisure moments in the study of Tacitus, Virgil, or
Homer, kept ready to hand under their counters. But,
invariably, it was only the intelligence that was kept always
in training, while the nobler faculties remained strangled
and atrophied by the constant use of cunning and trickery.
This was destined to lead, sooner or later, to the inevitable
decay of the Republic's moral and political life, and to
the decline of the highest mental culture. If the manner
in which wars were planned and conducted caused fatal
results, no less fatal were the ulterior consequences of
victorious campaigns. For the hired troops once paid
off, changed from friends into foes, and instantly sought
to sell their services to some other employer. Failing to
find one, and therefore receiving no pay, they dispersed
in armed bands, ravaging town and country, by a species
of military brigandage. Generally, it was found requisite
to come to terms with them, and bribe them to keep the
peace.</p>

<p>But the most important point to be noted at this
juncture is that the conquest of fresh territory, although
become an absolute necessity to the Republic, now began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
to be a serious danger and the source of future calamities.
During the Middle Ages the Italian Commune had been
a fertile cause of progress; but as its possessions outside
the walls began to increase, it proved wholly powerless
to convert the free city into what we call a State without
working radical changes in its constitution. In fact, even
in Florence, the most democratic of our communes,
citizens were only to be found within the circuit of the
walls. Laws were framed to ameliorate the condition of
the territory outside and to abolish serfdom there, but no
one contemplated endowing inhabitants of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> with
political rights. The title of citizens always remained,
as it were, a privilege only granted to a minority, even
of dwellers within the walls, and was never extended to
the people at large. Whenever a new city was conquered
and subjected to the Republic, it was governed more or
less harshly; allowed to retain more or fewer local
privileges; sometimes even permitted to retain a republican
form of government, subject to the authority
of a Podestà, captain, or commissary, and paying the taxes
imposed by them; but its inhabitants never enjoyed the
freedom of the City, nor were their representatives by
any chance admitted to the councils or political offices of
Florence. Accordingly, as the State became enlarged by
fresh conquests, the cluster of citizens monopolising the
government, and already very limited in number, sank to
a still smaller minority compared with the ever-increasing
population subject to their rule. Similarly to all other
republicans of the Middle Ages, the Florentines were
altogether unable to conceive the idea of a State governed
with a view to the general welfare. On the contrary, the
prosperity and grandeur of Florence formed the one object
and aim to which every other consideration had to be
subservient. Nor had the lower classes and populace,
who were always clamouring for increased freedom, any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
different or wider views on the subject. Their ideas,
indeed, being restricted in a narrower circle, were even
more prejudiced, as their passions were blinder. Consequently
it was considered at that time a greater calamity
to be subjugated by a fellow republic than by a monarchy;
inasmuch as princes brought their tyranny to bear equally
on all alike, and thus, at any rate as regarded politics, the
chief majority of the conquered suffered less injury.
When Florence, however, by achieving the long-desired
conquest of Pisa, at last became mistress of the sea, and
witnessed the rapid increase of her commerce, she discovered
that the annexation of a great and powerful
republic, full of life and strength and possessed of so
large a trade, brought her none of the advantages which
might have ensued from a union of a freer kind with an
equal distribution of political rights. The chief citizens
of Pisa and all the wealthier families left the country,
preferring to live in Lombardy, France, or even in Sicily
under the Aragonese, where at least they enjoyed civil
equality, rather than remain in their own city subject to
the harsh and tyrannous rule of Florentine shopkeepers.
The commerce and industry of Pisa, her navy, her
merchant-fleet, all vanished when freedom fell; while
her <i>Studio</i>, or university, one of the old glories of Italy,
and afterwards reconstituted by the Medici, was done
away with, and the city soon reduced to a state of squalid
desolation. All conquered cities suffered this fate; those
once of the richest and most powerful in the days of their
freedom being treated with still greater harshness than
the <span class="locked">rest.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></span> This makes it easy to understand why, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Florence was in danger, all conquered cities in which life
was not altogether extinguished invariably seized the
opportunity to try to regain their independence, and
always preferred a native or foreign tyrant to cowering
beneath the yoke of a republic that refused to learn from
experience the wisdom of changing its policy. Nor could
it have effected such change without radically altering its
whole constitution and manner of existence.</p>

<p>Thus, in accumulating riches and power, Florence was
only multiplying the causes of her approaching and unavoidable
decline. The Commune seemed increasingly
incapable of giving birth to the modern State, and accordingly,
when its chief support, commerce, began to decay,
the strength of the burghers was sapped, and the oppressed
multitude, now a formidable majority, speedily
looked to monarchical rule for their relief. Thus the
Medici were enabled to attain supremacy in the name of
freedom, and with the support of people and populace.
Thus, likewise, by violence, or fraud, or by both combined,
the communes of Italy were all reduced to principalities;
and wherever, from exceptional causes, the republican
order still lingered on for a while, it was only as a shadow
of its former self, and no longer rendering any of the
advantages for which it had been originally designed.
Populations which had failed to establish equality by
means of free institutions, were now forced to learn the
lesson of equality beneath the undiscriminating oppression
of a despotic prince. Signories formed the necessary link<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
of transition between the mediæval commune and the
modern state. For these Signories traced a way towards
the just administration and method pursued by the vast
kingdoms then in course of formation on the continent of
Europe, and which also remained absolute and despotic
monarchies until the French revolution effected in town,
country, and throughout every class that work of social
emancipation which the Italian communes had so admirably
initiated, but had never learnt to extend beyond the
circuit of their walls.</p>

<p>Florence maintained a prolonged resistance, but finally
shared the fate of her fellow republics.</p>

<p class="drop-capii"><span class="smcap">IT</span> is certain that no real national history
of Italy can be written until the statutes
and laws of our communes have been
published, studied, and thoroughly investigated
by the light not merely of
historical but of legal research. The
necessity for such investigation was first proclaimed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
learned Savigny, subsequently recognised by many Italian
scholars, but has never yet been entirely satisfied. An
accurate study of those old laws and statutes would make
us acquainted with the public law of the communes, and
place before our eyes a clear and exact picture of their
political institutions which have been hitherto very
imperfectly understood. Moreover, what is certainly of
no less importance&mdash;it would enlarge our knowledge of
our ancient private law, to which many learned authorities,
among others Francesco Forti, attribute the origin of
modern jurisprudence, and the germs of many jural
provisions, afterwards accepted by us as novelties derived
from the French Code.</p>

<p>Public and private law have far more affinity than is
generally supposed, and each conduces to the plainer and
more exact comprehension of the other. Society and the
State have both their birth in the family, reacting upon
and modifying it in turn. No student therefore who
seeks to discover the true key to political institutions
developing themselves in a country spontaneously, should
neglect the constitution of the family wherein are to be
found the earliest beginnings of civil law, with which
political law also is more or less connected. Cases, it is
true, frequently occur of one people adopting the civil
law of another, without altering its own political institutions;
while in other instances both are imposed simultaneously
by a superior foreign force. This has led many
to question the reality of the connection which in fact
subsists between them. But these cases have nothing to
do with that natural and spontaneous development of law
of which we are now speaking. In this development,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
politics and jurisprudence, the State and the family, are
found to be closely interconnected.</p>

<p>In the course of Florentine history we often see
political revolutions break out suddenly and apparently
without warning; but on closer examination we perceive
them to be the result of deep social changes which have
been maturing for a long time, and although imperceptible
at first, afterwards assuming such proportions as
to become suddenly visible to all eyes and productive of
political reforms. Thus it happens that private law, which
always accompanies social movements and changes with
them, not unfrequently enables us to trace the sources
and unfold the true tendency and inexorable necessity of
revolutions, even before they come to pass. Accordingly,
the habitual neglect of this particular study in connection
with the history of Italy has proved a serious defect. No
one at the present day would venture to write the political
history of Rome without giving attention to the Roman
jurisprudence. Nevertheless, we have written the history
of our republics over and over again, without bestowing
a thought on their civil and penal legislation.</p>

<p>It is true that the investigation required presents very
great difficulties, inasmuch as our history was subject,
during the Middle Ages, to a series of changes, always
rapid and always different. The number of our republics
is infinite. Every province of Italy, every fragment of
Italian territory is divided and subdivided into communes,
every one of which has a distinct history, and political
institutions which are constantly changing. This perpetual
mutation is faithfully reflected in the statutes of the
Commune. On the margins of these statutes we find
alterations and corrections registered from year to year,
and formulated, not unfrequently, after the streets of the
city had begun to run with blood. When annotations
and corrections reach a certain number, the statutes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
drafted anew, and of these re-drafts also many copies are
still extant. It was the duty of the officials in charge of
the statutes (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">statutari</span></i>) to enter from time to time such
farther modifications as were afterwards approved of in
the Councils of the People. Hence it sometimes happens
that on referring to the statutes of a given year, we may
find the duties of some chief magistrate of the Republic
set forth in their text with the most minute detail, whereas
if we look to the notes it will appear that these duties
have already been changed. If we next consult the remodelled
statute it will be found that the magistracy
itself no longer exists. How is it possible, therefore, to
give any idea of the political form of a municipality
fashioned in such wise? This can only be done by
gleaning from the mass of the statutes the history of the
constitution through all its successive changes of form.
In a word, we must recognise that, instead of being confronted
by a system crystallised, fixed and immutable,
we are watching a living organism develop under our
eyes in obedience to a settled law. This law alone is
uniform, and it is this we must endeavour to trace, since
it alone can solve the mystery and supply exact ideas.
Turning from public law to private legislation, our
difficulties rather increase than diminish. For, in perusing
this, by no means less important portion of the
statutes, we come upon a confused medley of legal
systems differing from and often opposed to one another.
When we meet with such terms as <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">meta</span></i> and <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i>,
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">wergild</span></i> and <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">morgengab</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">dos</span></i> and <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">tutela</span></i>, testamentary
succession and succession by agreement, we recognise
that Longobard law, Roman law, feudal law, and canon
law are all present, and perceive that they are blended
in constantly varying proportions. These diverse legal
systems act and react one upon the other, producing
reciprocal changes. Into the Roman law, provisions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
constantly filtering which indubitably belong to the
Longobard law, while the latter in its turn is profoundly
modified ("mutilated and castrated," as Gans expresses
it) by the Roman law. How are we to explain this
congeries of different laws? Is there any new and
original principle that assimilates the heterogeneous
elements and constitutes a new law? If so, what is it?
This is the knotty problem which Savigny encouraged us
to attack, but which we have hitherto failed to unravel. But
although the question remains unsolved, its importance
is now universally acknowledged; it has been carefully
studied, and many treatises, including some of the highest
value, have been published on the subject. Accordingly
certain observations may at last be offered to the public.</p>

<p>The constitution of the family and its relation with
the State are, as it were, the chief centre round which all
fresh researches must revolve, and these form the subject
of this short and summary essay. As a preliminary
step towards the solution of the problem, an accurate
investigation is required of the various forms that the
family assumed under the various systems of law which
succeeded one another in Italy, in order to ascertain how
it was that from the combination of those various forms,
another and widely different one should have resulted.
The first question therefore that presents itself has reference
to the condition of the Roman law and the Roman
family at the time of the barbarian invasion. As regards
the Italian communes, it is only natural that the Roman
jurisprudence should strike the deepest and strongest root
in their social system, and that the history of our laws
should originally find in it their first beginning. Here,
however, we are forced to enter on a digression which,
although seemingly apart from the point, will presently
help us to a clearer understanding of the new society in
course of development. With regard to this digression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
it should also be said that so much learning and research
have been directed to the study of Roman law, that we
are able to arrive at certain trustworthy conclusions which,
by affording evidence of the close connection between the
Roman family, and the political society derived from it,
will show us what path to take in pursuit of the same
connection in the history of Italy.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Every student of the Pandects knows that the words
"Roman law" denote the outcome of long preliminary
labours, and the ultimate form of a jurisprudence which
cannot be rightly understood without analysing all the
historical elements employed in preparing and building it
up. Treated in this way, the history of Roman law
becomes, as it were, instantly transformed into a history
of many different legislations following one another at
intervals. From the Twelve Tables down to Justinian,
this law never halts for an hour in its constant course of
development. Even during the Middle Ages, when the
compilations made at Constantinople were studied with
religious zeal by expounders and commentators whose sole
object was to faithfully reproduce and diffuse this law,
even thus, in the hands of those interpreters, influenced
by the altered spirit of the times and by new social
developments, it underwent changes of which they were
not themselves conscious. It is not until the fifteenth
century that this historic development can be said to have
ceased among us, and Roman law become mainly a subject
of learned research. It is at this time that a new and
modern system of jurisprudence first reveals itself to
history, endowed with a separate life, and with a form of its
own, though borrowing much from the Roman law, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
in consequence continues to be of the utmost value to
us, and still deserves our most assiduous attention,
although for a very different purpose from that with
which it was studied during the Middle Ages. Our
object is now to familiarise ourselves with an immortal
monument of ancient wisdom, to shape our legal education
by it, to be helped by it to a clearer understanding
of our own codes, and to contemplate it in its
successive manifestations, while we search for its regulating
law. It is in fact the discovery of this law that has at
once thrown a new light upon the whole history of Roman
jurisprudence, which we perceive to have been always and
unceasingly governed by it, and thus forced to assume a
character so constant and continuous through all its various
transformations, that what had before seemed to be a series
of distinct legislations takes an entirely new aspect, making
us spectators, as it were, of the evolution of a single idea,
the progressive development of a work of Nature.</p>

<p>All this continuous progress or evolution was the result
of two forces, of two different elements. The true, primitive
law of Rome was the special law of the Quirites, of
which we find the remains in the Twelve Tables: a severe
and restricted law abounding in formulas which had to
be sacredly observed, and its administration was entrusted
to a small number of citizens who alone were acquainted
with its rules, whose authority was sanctioned by religion.
The smallest mistake of form made void the most just
decree, and where the law omitted to define the formula
to be observed, no valid action could be brought. When
the due formula, making the contract binding, had once
been pronounced, no proof of mistake or fraud could
annul it. "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Uti lingua nuncupassit ita ius esto.</span>" A slave
to forms, the judge could not listen to the voice of
morality or rectitude; the most just complaint failed to
move him, unless supported by a text of law. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
defendant dared not stir a step without the continual
guidance of the legislator, inasmuch as every juridical
formula was sacred and inviolable; and as the science of
law was monopolised by the College of Pontiffs, the most
aristocratic and conservative body in Rome, it became a
kind of occult science. It was this very character, however,
apparently so restricted and pedantic, that gave its
great force to the law in Rome. For law, being now freed
for the first time from every extraneous element belonging
to morals and good faith, became firm and inexorable.
Any one who had the law in his favour was safe to see it
promptly carried out. History affords no example elsewhere
of legal sanction and redress being applied so
swiftly and surely as in Rome. In Athens, indeed, where
the laws were more philosophical, and the popular
conscience gave judgment, investigating motives, despising
formulas, and looking only to substantial justice, caprice
often prevailed, and law never attained the iron strength
and tenacity of the Roman jurisprudence.</p>

<p>But with changing times, all things changed in Rome.
This jurisprudence revered as sacred, but described by
Vico as <i>made up of formulas and phrases</i>, was well adapted
to a rude and primitive people. Ideas had greatly altered
in the days of Cicero, who in his speech <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro Murena</span></i>
severely satirises a science which, in his eyes, had become
ridiculous: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">res enim sunt parvæ, prope in singulis literis
atque interpunctionibus occupatæ.</span>" He looked upon the
whole thing as a fraud designed by the priests to secure
themselves a monopoly. Was he in the right or the
wrong? Vico, in examining a similar question, showed
that Cicero was mistaken on this score. Cicero and his
contemporaries, he said, lived in too cultivated an age to
comprehend rude and primitive jurisprudence; they could
not grasp its true significance, but formed their judgment
of the ancient laws according to the ideas and principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
of their own times. This view, which was first broached
in the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Scienza Nuova</span></i>, was afterwards accepted by many
other writers; and it is now placed beyond a doubt that
the primitive Roman law was not the artifice of a learned
few, but was a spontaneous and necessary growth among
the people with whom it had its origin. At first, custom,
clearly distinguished from the law formulated and written,
tempered its rigid severity. Good faith and equity, disregarded
and rejected by the law, found their sanction in
custom, were administered by a separate tribunal, and
were always respected, inasmuch as the sentence pronounced
by the officiating magistrate was morally, though
not legally, binding, and was therefore of great efficacy as
the genuine expression of public opinion. The sentence
of condemnation could not be carried out by force; but
it made the condemned man infamous, and, as a last resort,
the magistrate could cite the accused before the people, as
the supreme legislator and judge.</p>

<p>But at a later date customs grew corrupt, and no longer
sufficed to protect public good faith and morality, which
were driven to seek asylum and sanction in the law, and
so began gradually to modify its primitive character.
Substance now prevailed over form, equity over the
ancient text of the law, the intention of the contracting
parties over words uttered by mistake; the law became
more moral as customs grew more degraded. This transformation,
though very gradual at the beginning, was
afterward, accelerated by the new conditions of the
Republics in which a change took place not unlike that
occurring in the history of jurisprudence, towards the
beginning of the seventeenth century. At that time the
various European States, with their various systems of
law, having contracted new relations with one another,
came to recognise the necessity of establishing some fixed
rules by which all should be bound, and thus, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
auspices of Hugh Grotius, the so-called School of Natural
Law was built up. The same occurred in Rome, if not
in the science, at any rate in the practice of law. As the
dominion of the Republic became extended in Italy, its relations
increased with neighbouring nations, among whom
the more philosophical and less severe laws and principles
of the Greek jurisprudence prevailed. It was impossible
to impose upon all these nations, without modification,
the rigid law of the Roman patriciate. Accordingly a
new system of law, of a simpler character and wider
reach, took shape and rapidly grew. This was named the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">jus gentium</span></i>, to distinguish it from the other, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">jus
civile</span></i>. "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Jus gentium est quod naturalis ratio inter omnes
homines constituit.</span>" This system, however, was not
deduced from philosophic theories concerning human
nature, as was the, appropriately styled, natural law of
the eighteenth century; it originated in the practical
needs of the Romans and their new relations with other
Italian peoples: it was fostered by the principles of Greek
jurisprudence that had been transplanted into Southern
Italy; it met the new requirements of the Romans themselves;
and taking the place that custom had previously
filled in the Roman courts, grew side by side with the law
of the Patricians with which it long maintained its union.</p>

<p>There were thus two systems of law in force in Rome;
and we accordingly find on the one hand judges and courts
faithful to the ancient formalism, on the other, judges and
courts taking cognizance of equity and good faith, and
almost discharging the duties of the Censor. The continuous
onward progress of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">jus gentium</span></i>, the reciprocal
action of the two legal systems ultimately fusing them into
one, wherein the old Roman formation gradually lost its
rigidity, and equity, becoming incorporated with the civil
law, began to assume a more definite and regular form,
were all consequences of the principle which dominates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
life and history of the Roman law, and may even be said
to constitute it. For it has been moulded and diffused
through the world, inheriting from the old Quirites its
frame of iron; from contact with other races and from such
germs as it could assimilate of Greek civilisation, its more
comprehensive and human spirit. Assuming thus a character
at once exact and philosophical, it seemed as though
destined to become, from its superiority, the universal
jurisprudence, the indispensable foundation, as it were, of
all future legislation. This union of legal systems was
effected by the Prætor. He it was who represented both
the modern spirit and the ancient, enlarging the old law
with the defences of equity which he strengthened by submitting
it to the trammels of a formal procedure. This
in substance was what took place with regard to customs,
letters, and everything else. The fusion of Greek civilisation
with the Roman constitutes the history of the ancient
world.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>As is natural, we also meet with the same phenomena in
the history of the family, from which the civil law is to
a great extent derived. In fact, whoever contemplates the
primitive Roman family, at once recognises it as the basis
upon which the future juridical and political greatness of
Rome was erected. The family is sacred; the father is
absolute master of the goods, the liberty and the life
both of his wife and of his children. He is priest, judge,
supreme arbiter: wife, children, and grandchildren form
with him a single joint society, one legal entity of which
he is the representative. The woman may be bartered
away, killed, or sold in execution; freed by marriage from
the despotic control of her father, she at once falls under
that of her husband; her legal incapacity lasts through her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
whole life. But primitive customs so temper this harsh
law that we find no other people of antiquity so observant
of the sanctity of family, or showing so much respect to
woman. Matrimony is styled "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">consortium omnis vitæ,
divini et humani iuris communicatio.</span>" Divorce on the part
of the husband (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">repudium</span></i>) is not forbidden by law, but
any man who repudiates his wife is dishonoured by the
Censor, excommunicated by the priest, and for a period of
five centuries few cases of repudiation are recorded. In
ancient Greece some traces of oriental polygamy are still
discernible, but in Italy monogamy is coeval with Rome
itself. Natural children, as such, never rank as members
of the family, but they may be legitimated. Adoption
is a solemn act, the moral propriety of which is
referred to the decision of the pontifex, as the guardian
of the sanctity of the family, and is thus submitted
to the popular sanction. The woman is never seen in
places of public resort, nor does she attend popular gathering;
but within doors she is <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">domina</span></i>, and the husband
addresses her by that title. The <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Atrium</span></i> is the centre and
sanctuary of the house. Here relations, friends, and
strangers meet together; here stand the domestic hearth,
the altar dedicated to the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Lares</span></i>, and all those objects which
the family holds sacred: the nuptial coach, the ancestral
likenesses moulded in wax from the faces of the dead, the
matron's rock and spindle, the chest containing the household
records and monies. All these possessions are entrusted
to the care and superintendence of the mother of
the family, who, together with her husband, sacrifices to
the gods and assists him in the management of the common
patrimony: she directs all domestic work, and
watches over the education of her children. In the
annals and legends of Rome the name of some heroine,
such as Virginia or Lucretia, is indissolubly linked with
the chief glories of the Eternal City. It is not so in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
Greece. In instituting and sanctifying the family, the
Romans laid the foundation-stone of the Capitol. But to
maintain this primitive nucleus of Roman society firm and
compact, the law must always watch with vigilance and
multiply its ordinances. The property of the family
must be kept together as strictly as possible and for the
longest possible time. The father is its sole master and
arbiter; but on his death the patrimony is equally divided
between sons and daughters. The <i>unity</i> of the family
must also be guarded and defended by the law, since there
is serious danger that a woman marrying may carry away
from the family an interest in the family property. She is
accordingly subjected by the law to a perpetual tutelage
which prevents her from disposing at will of her own
property. On the death of her father the woman comes
under the tutelage of the agnati. In Cicero's day, when
as Vico has noted, the true significance of primitive
Roman law had been lost, lawyers believed that this tutelage
of women had been established on account of the
weakness of the sex, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">propter sexus infirmitatem</span></i>. But
Gaius refers to this opinion as a plausible and prevalent
error, and maintains that the restriction was instituted in
the interest of the agnati, so that the woman, whose presumptive
heirs they were, should have no power to alienate,
diminish, or otherwise defraud them of their <span class="locked">inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></span></p>

<p>So long as the woman remained under the tutelage of
her father, inasmuch as she had not yet inherited, the law
allowed her to incur legal obligations. The danger for the
family began when, on her father's death, she became an
heir. It was from that precise moment, accordingly, that
she came under the tutelage of her own heirs the agnati, and
could no longer bind herself without their consent. This
tutelage, therefore, became not merely a duty on the part
of the agnati, but was also a right and privilege. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
the agnate was a minor, of weak mind, or otherwise incapacitated,
he did not forfeit this right, but it had to be
exercised by a third party. The tutor fixed the dowry to be
given with the woman on her marriage; but the remainder
of her patrimony had to be preserved intact, that it might
return afterwards to the agnati. No woman could make
a will, that she might not have it in her power to defraud
the family. On passing <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">in manus viri</span></i>, the woman underwent
a <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">capitis diminutio</span></i>. She entered another family, as
it were, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">loco filiæ</span></i>, and her new relations became her lawful
heirs. Under these circumstances the law permitted
her to make a testamentary disposition, whereby, notwithstanding
her new relationships, she might restore her
patrimony to her own original family.</p>

<p>When the woman was under the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">manus</span></i> of her husband,
she was emancipated from the paternal authority and from
the tutelage of her agnates. The displeasure thereby
caused to her own family was so great that, before long,
marriage by simple consent was resorted to, according to
which the woman became personally subject to her husband's
authority, but he had no right of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">manus</span></i> over her,
and consequently no power over her property. In this
way the woman remained under the power of her father
or of the agnates, and at the same time came under the
authority of her husband, an arrangement that inevitably
led to many collisions, and hastened the advent of the
most radical change in the Roman family&mdash;the complete
independence of woman. But, before reaching this point,
disputes were for a long time kept in check and efficaciously
remedied by the mediating influence of a most
important institution&mdash;the domestic tribunal. This family
council, regulated by usage, not law, was composed of
agnates, cognates, relations, and sometimes also of friends.
It presided at espousals and at the assumption of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">toga
virilis</span></i>; it protected orphans; it aided the head of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
family in adjudicating and in awarding punishment, and
acted as a restraint on his authority. By law, the father
could act even without the co-operation of the Council;
but by doing so, he exposed himself to being publicly
blamed and noted with ignominy by the Censor, who,
if necessary, might accuse him before the people. The
marriageable maiden was subject to and protected by this
Council.</p>

<p>Becoming a wife by that form of marriage which
brought her <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">in manus viri</span></i>, she left her own family to
become member of another; but if not married under
that form, she still remained subject to the family Council,
in which her husband was now included.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>In the age of Cæsar, the Roman family is no longer
what it was at first. Laws, usages, ideas, all are changed;
and everything is moving onward to a still more radical
transformation. The <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">jus gentium</span></i> seems to have become
identical with the more rigorous <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">jus civile</span></i>. The <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">fideicommissum</span></i>
has almost the force of a testament in solemn
form, and has become part, as it were, of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">jus civile</span></i>;
<i>verbal contract</i>, the ancient <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">stipulatio</span></i>, once so hampered
by formulas, is grown so flexible as to resemble a contract
under the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">jus gentium</span></i>. But the greatest change of all has
taken place in the family. The domestic hearth is no
longer the household sanctuary. The <i>Atrium</i> is transformed
into an open courtyard, enlivened with flowers
and limpid fountains, ornamented with gilded busts and
statues, often of an obscene character. Sacrifices are no
longer offered there to the gods amid the stillness and
purity of domestic and religious affection; it now serves
the enriched and corrupt patrician as a place of reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
for his numerous friends and clients. The family of
former days, once almost a State within the State, is now
dissolved, and, as it were, swallowed up by the political
power. The agnates no longer cleave together, the
domestic tribunal has either lost its strength or has
entirely disappeared. Paternal authority, though less
absolute, is more oppressive, being no longer in harmony
with the changed customs. If a father disinherits his son,
the judge cancels the will. Should he refuse consent to
his son's marriage, the State compels him to grant it;
should he punish his son with death, the emperor sends
him into exile; he cannot ill-use even his slaves without
being punished by the law, for the law has grown moral
as manners become more corrupt. By gradual degrees
woman escapes from tutelage, and from <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">manus</span></i>, and
ultimately attains her independence. But the more she
is emancipated from her family and relations, the greater
becomes her subjection to the State. In her new independence
she incurs new disabilities, no longer resulting
from her position as daughter or wife, but from the fact
of her sex, disabilities no longer imposed in the interest
of the family, but created as a protection for her infirmity.
This explains how it was that the lawyers of later days
were mistaken as to the significance of the old law touching
the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">tutela</span></i> of woman. The wife's dowry is guaranteed to
her more and more strictly, until it finally becomes her
almost inseparable property. It must neither be alienated
nor diminished. On her becoming a widow, being
divorced, or returning to the paternal roof, she remains
absolute mistress of it. A husband who surprises his wife
in adultery can no longer&mdash;hiding his dishonour within
his own walls&mdash;judge and put her to death with the
consent of the domestic tribunal. He must now leave
the State to avenge his wrongs, and must resort to the
courts, even though seeking only minor penalties. Divorce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
has become a public act of not unfrequent occurrence.
The woman, in short, is no longer under her husband's
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">manus</span></i>, no longer subject to the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">patria potestas</span></i>, no longer
under the tutelage of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">agnati</span></i>: she is protected by the
State. When the law still requires her to have a <i>tutor</i>
or procurator, she can choose a stranger who becomes her
servant rather than her master. Eventually even this
last shadow of subjection disappears. Absolutely her own
mistress, the woman may now hold property, increase her
fortune, make her will, lose her virtue; but her dowry,
guaranteed and kept intact by law, remains hers to the
end of her life.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as regards succession, the woman's rights
are not yet the same as the man's. It is true, that should
her father die intestate, she takes an equal share with her
brothers of the inheritance; but in all other cases of
intestacy the nearest female agnate stands after the most
distant male. The woman cannot now do any legal act
for others, though this had not been forbidden previously;
she cannot be a witness; she cannot stand security for
the debts of others. The <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Senatus-consultum Velleianum</span></i>
lays it down as a fixed rule, which, to a certain extent,
has remained in force to our own days&mdash;that the woman
must not undertake any obligation on behalf of others.
She may alienate her possessions in others' favour, may
incur a direct obligation, contract a debt, and transfer the
money to others; but she cannot bind herself to pay
another's debt, nor guarantee its payment. In the legislator's
opinion, the infirmity of her sex leaves her enough
intelligence to escape danger in assuming direct obligations,
or by alienating her property, but not enough to guard
her from lightly undertaking remote and indirect liabilities
which are often no less serious.</p>

<p>But the progressive changes in the Roman family are
not yet at an end. To the numberless causes for change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
already in existence another is added, when Christianity
finds its way into the Empire, into literature and law,
and subverts all things. According to the law of Christ,
man and woman are equal; father and mother have equal
rights and duties in respect of their children, for whose
advantage all things must be ordered; whereas, by the
old law, the rights of the children were subordinated to
the interests of the family. A new element is now introduced
into Roman law which further changes its character,
already much modified by Greek philosophy and by Byzantine
despotism. The Canon law accepts the principles of
the Roman, recognises the wife's absolute interest in her
marriage portion, and rejects the pretensions of the husband.
Woman remains excluded from every office which
the ancients deemed proper to man; she cannot enter into
obligations for others, nor arbitrate, nor lay an accusation,
nor bear witness in court; her evidence has no legal
effect. On the other hand, Roman law tends inexorably
to democratic equality, natural equity, and to the absolute
predominance of the State. The public authority deprives
domestic authority of its last remnant of power; it may
almost be said that the family, as a body-politic, disappears,
to be reconstituted on the footing of reciprocal affection.
The final seal to these alterations was imposed by the
famous law of succession (Nov. 118 and 127) enacted by
Justinian in the years 543 and 547, which, suppressing
every privilege of sex and agnation, fixes rights according
to the degree of relationship, and makes them reciprocal.
It moreover enlarges the amount of the legitim, and
ordains that the dowry of the wife should be met by
a <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">donatio propter nuptias</span></i> of equal value from the husband,
and that, in the interest of the children, both should be
inalienable. Even with the consent of his wife, the
husband cannot sell the dowry; he may only administer
it, and there must be complete reciprocity. The wife is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
not only the owner of the dowry, she has besides a general
charge over her husband's property for its restitution, with
a right of action to enforce it as against all his other
creditors. In inheriting from their children the mother
has equal right with the father, and she is now qualified to
be their guardian. Even the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Senatus-consultum Velleianum</span></i>,
which forbade women to incur obligations on behalf of
others, is modified with the same scope. Justinian, indeed,
from his desire to protect the property of the woman against
all danger, is strenuously opposed to her incurring obligations
on behalf of her husband; but he is much more
indulgent in respect to obligations undertaken on behalf
of a stranger. These, if incurred for manifestly good
cause, are valid if renewed after two years. Thus
modified, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Senatus-consultum Velleianum</span></i> is treated with
respect throughout the Middle Ages. Reciprocal equality
is now achieved, but the ancient unity of the family is
dissolved; the compact and iron nucleus of Roman society
is broken to fragments by the continual and increasing
action of the State. In all her institutions, Rome has
succeeded in arriving at democracy and equality, but at
the cost of complete individual liberty, and by sacrificing
the development of special associations and of local life
to the unity of the State. How to conciliate these two
elements without destroying the one in the interest of
the other will be the problem of a new era and a new
civilisation.</p>

<p>However highly we may rate the amazing and indisputable
greatness of the labours of Imperial legislators and
juris-consults collected in the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corpus iuris</span></i> in the time of
Justinian, it is nevertheless certain that the ancient and
primitive character of Roman law has been profoundly
changed by it, and that the despotism of the State, always
prevalent in Rome, has been enormously increased. It is
for this reason that Tocqueville, and others with him, go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
so far as to maintain that the great diffusion of the
Justinian law among the Latin races has more than once
proved hurtful to political freedom. To many, such an
assertion may seem absurd; but granting that there is a
close bond of connection between private and public law,
and that the final changes in Roman law were introduced
by the action of the growing despotism of the State, the
opinion advanced by the French writer is not without its
value.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>However that may be, it is undeniable that the family,
as we now find it constituted, or, more correctly speaking,
weakened, by the Justinian law has not the qualities which
would enable it, in the ages of barbarism now at hand,
to withstand the violent onset of the advancing Germanic
peoples, much less to be the nucleus and germ from which
the new society of the Italian Commune may take birth.
In fact, in the statutes we find the family constituted on
a very different footing. Agnation has recovered its
ascendancy. The woman is under a new species of
guardianship; and although the dotal system is rigorously
observed, there are innumerable regulations designed to keep
family property together, or make it revert to the family,
so as to preserve the domestic patrimony intact. Here
an important question arises, namely, whether this new
constitution of the family, which stands in close relation
with the public law of the communes, is a return to the
pre-Justinian law, or derived from Germanic institutions
and the Longobard law, in which we find, in fact, precedence
accorded to agnate kin and a more stable family
organisation? Italian writers, the earlier writers more
especially, adhered for the most part to the former theory,
while the majority of German authors, who have recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
found disciples even among ourselves, adopt the second
view. Thus, on either side we find theories propounded
as to the constitution of the Italian family in the Middle
Ages, analogous to those concerning the origin of the
<span class="locked">communes.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></span></p>

<p>The persistence of Roman law in the Middle Ages,
even when the condition of the Italians was most wretched,
and when all things seemed to be subject to the law of the
Longobard, was maintained with marvellous learning and
acumen in the immortal work of Savigny. But, in truth,
though public law and penal law might readily be altered
under the rule of the conqueror, there was little likelihood
that the civil law which, for so many centuries, had filtered
into the usages and into the very blood of the Romans,
which had regulated the manifold relations of a civilised
people and satisfied its countless requirements, should
perish utterly beneath the sword of barbarians unconscious
of those requirements and not always able to comprehend
those relations. Matters of which they were to a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
extent ignorant, or as to which they were indifferent,
must often have been passed over without notice in the
laws framed by the barbarians, or have evaded their
action. Various provisions, therefore, of the Roman law&mdash;those,
for instance, relating to marriage, to succession, and
to contract&mdash;must often have continued to be applied by
the Italians in conformity with ancient usage. This will
be more readily understood if we reflect that while the
Roman law had become the law of <i>all</i> in those countries
in which the Roman conquest had taken deep root, the laws
of the barbarians, on the contrary, according to Teutonic
usage, always presented a personal character&mdash;that is to
say, extended only to the people with whom they originated,
and were not easily communicated to others. In fact,
when, as a consequence of successive invasions, different
Germanic tribes, whether independent of each other or
in subjection one to another, came together in the same
country, each of them continued to be governed by its
own peculiar laws. The Romans, on the contrary, regarding
their law as universal in character, communicated it to,
and imposed it upon all. It was almost the first germ of
the greatness and the civilisation of Rome, and for that
reason its diffusion was considered the most sacred of
duties by this sovereign people. Thus it was that, even
under the harshest barbaric oppression, the Roman law
continued to be the private law of the Italians in all
those cases, and they were not few, in which the German
laws failed to notice it, and neither abrogated it directly
nor substituted another in its place.</p>

<p>But the presence of two diverse legislations, the one
imposed by force, the other preserved by custom,
the radical change of conditions occasioned by the
destruction of the old Roman State and the formation
of a new society, could not fail to originate a
new life, a new history for the Italian law. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
statute books of our communes we find Roman and
Longobard law confronted and almost contending, each
modified in turn by the action of the other. But under
which of the many forms through which it has passed is
the Roman law found among us at the moment when it
seemed on the point of being overcome by the Germanic
law? Was it in the literary and philosophic form given
to it by Justinian, or was it in the <i>pre</i>-Justinian form,
which, while less systematic, was also less altered by
Byzantine ideas, and more in accordance with usage?
Savigny roundly asserts that the Pandects on their completion
were at once sent into Italy, and that immediately
after the power of the Goths had been shattered by the
Greeks Justinian hastened to issue the Constitution (534),
whereby legal effect was given to them in the land.
In consequence of this, he continues, the Pandects were
then to be met with in every corner of Italy, where they
were at once received with favour, inasmuch as the
Justinian law was specially adapted to the requirements of
the land. This, he goes on to say, likewise explains
why it was that all the earliest Italian commentators or
glossators devoted themselves exclusively to the study of
the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corpus iuris</span></i>. The reader, however, may easily
discover that, on this head, Savigny has pushed his inferences
too far. More than once, indeed, he is compelled
to put a false interpretation on documents that they
may not contradict his theories; and more than once the
documents themselves seem to warn him that, even in the
Middle Ages, vestiges of a <i>pre</i>-Justinian law are to be
traced; but he persists still more resolutely in considering
all this to be only a survival of antiquated forms. Many new
documents have recently been published, and the question
again presents itself, always with the same urgency.</p>

<p>As a German writer, well versed in the subject, has
recently observed, everything tends to show that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
history of Roman law in the Middle Ages should be
divided into two entirely distinct <span class="locked">periods.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></span> During the
first it endured by force of custom, and accordingly many
pre-Justinian formulas survived with it; in the second
and much later period the Justinian law prevailed, promoted
still further by the literary study of the Pandects
undertaken by the Bolognese professors; it was only then
that the most ancient formulas wholly disappeared. This
view is supported by documentary evidence and harmonises
with the character of the times and with the requirements
of society, and is confirmed by our old writers and our
literary traditions.</p>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 383.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>In fact, Savigny himself examines and recognises the
full importance of the various sources of <i>pre</i>-Justinian
law diffused in the Middle Ages. The code of Theodosius
(438) which then possessed great authority, and the edict
drawn up by order of Theodoric the Ostrogoth (500),
were direct compilations of the old Roman Jurisprudence.</p>

<p>If in these compilations we turn our attention to the
constitution of the family, more particularly as regards
succession, we find it exactly as it was before the law was
interwoven with the Imperial <span class="locked">edicts.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></span> The Breviary of
Alaric ("Lex Romana Visigothorum") and the so-called
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Papian</span></i> code ("Lex Romana Burgundioram"), both
posterior to the year 500, are likewise compilations of
<i>pre</i>-Justinian law, and are found to be diffused in several
provinces of the Empire. The often-mentioned "Lex
Romana Utiniensis, seu Curiensis," which seems to be
ninth century <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">rimpasto</span></i> of Alaric's Breviary for the use of
Italians in lands previously under Longobard rule, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
shows the same characteristics. It is true that, according
to the hypothesis of Savigny, the Breviary of Alaric must
have been in use among the Franks and brought by them
to Italy after the expulsion of the Longobards. In this
case we should find the old law to have been in force
among us only before and after the period of the Longobards;
while during their oppressive rule we should
discover no certain trace of it. But it is very difficult to
suppose that the ancient law, based as it was upon
custom, should have died out precisely when custom
might have preserved it, or that Roman law should at
that time have assumed the literary Justinian form and
afterwards have returned to a form more primitive. Had
the legislation of Justinian in its genuine form been once
accepted, it must have continued to gain ground with
the advance of civilisation and under the less severe
rule of the Franks, whose mode of life approached much
nearer to that of the Latins. The fact is, that throughout
the Middle Ages we meet with pre-Justinian legal forms,
more or less modified, even among the laws of the <span class="locked">Longobards.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></span>
As to the remark that the earliest Italian commentators,
the <i>glossators</i>, directed their studies to the
Pandects and the whole of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corpus iuris</span></i>&mdash;this only
shows that on the revival of the communes and of letters
they turned, as was natural, to the most authoritative and
literary source of jurisprudence. From that time, in fact,
no other is looked <span class="locked">for.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></span></p>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 384.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>It should also be remembered that, when the Greeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
came into Italy to combat the Goths, they found the
ancient Roman customary laws in force and sanctioned by
the edict of Theodoric; that the Goths were definitely
vanquished in 553; that in 568 the Greek domination
was followed by that of the Longobards; that the latter
confined their rivals to Southern Italy, whence they were
afterwards expelled by the Normans. There, in the south,
the corrupt Byzantine despotism proved no less fatal than
the oppression of the barbarians, and was perhaps the
prime cause of the many disasters and prolonged neglect
into which those provinces afterwards fell. But was it
possible for a dominion so brief and troubled to diffuse
the law of Justinian in Italy with such effect as not only
to make it universally accepted, but also so thoroughly
incorporated with customary law, that it could survive
even when its binding legal effect was no longer recognised
by the barbarians?</p>

<p>Such an hypothesis will seem even less tenable as regards
everything relating to the family and to succession, if we
reflect that the reforms introduced into this branch of the
law by Justinian at Constantinople in no way corresponded
to the conditions in which Italy then stood. Notwithstanding
the diffusion of Greek philosophy among us, the
spirit of Byzantium was by no means identical with that
of Rome, and there was still less identity in their social
conditions. In Constantinople Oriental despotism corrupted,
nay, suffocated society by excess of luxury and
over-refinement of culture; the State assuming everything
to itself, imparted a new character to the laws. In Italy,
on the other hand, society, no less corrupt, had become
disintegrated, and was already falling to pieces; the
ancient unity and strength of the State were continually
diminishing and losing strength, and less and less resistance
was opposed to the assaults of the barbarians. At
Constantinople the State was omnipotent, while in Italy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
its vigour was on the wane. Among us, accordingly
women and all who were weak were naturally driven to
seek refuge in private associations, and above all in the
bosom of the family. And if the natural force of events
had power to urge in any direction, and determine any new
tendency, it certainly could not have aimed at enfeebling
the family bond by subjecting it to the authority of a
tottering State, but must rather have sought to strengthen
it as the only possible safeguard amid the dangers that
were threatening on every side. This, in fact, is the course
always followed in barbaric societies, where, the State
being powerless, the care of the weak and the punishment
of injuries are entrusted to the kinsmen. In short, both
the disordered condition of Latin society and the example
of the barbarians themselves combined to offer grave
obstacles to the diffusion of Justinian's laws, more especially
when the old Roman customs were seen to be better
suited to the new and increasing needs of society, and
useful for the reconstruction, on a firmer basis, of the old
family system, now become more essential than before to
the common welfare. No other way was left for beginning
anew the social task and advancing afterwards to
new methods and institutions. Nor need we attach
much importance to the constitution of the year 534,
knowing how wide is the difference between the promulgation
of a law (especially when it is passed by a
short-lived and feeble Government in a society that is
lapsing into disorder) and its actual enforcement and
incorporation with custom. Even under the Roman
Republic, or under the Empire, old laws did not at once
disappear when new ones were proclaimed. Even in
modern societies we may note how tenaciously ancient
customs continue to be observed when they are more in
harmony with the character and requirements of the
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
The principles of the Napoleonic code were proclaimed
in our Southern provinces during the French domination
and afterwards confirmed by subsequent legislation; and
according to that code, every patrimony was bound to
be divided equally among the children. Nevertheless,
in the two Calabrias and many other Southern provinces,
property is still kept undivided in the family, since, by
common consent, only one of the sons marries, the others
remaining single. For the same reason, the smallest
possible sum is assigned to the daughters; nor do all of
them marry, some being persuaded or forced to take the
veil. Social progress alone will slowly give real effect to
the principles of equality sanctioned by the codes.</p>

<p>Everything therefore points to the conclusion that
Roman law survived among us to the downfall of the
Western Empire, preserving by usage many of the forms
that had belonged to it before the compilation of the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corpus iuris</span></i>. While in this state it came into contact
with the Germanic code, and thereupon began the series of
mutual alterations, from which the Italian family emerged,
reconstituted in a totally new way, and together with it
the Commune. It was a slow transformation, during which
Latin ideas and traditions steadily gained ground, and
gradually fused or destroyed the barbarian laws and institutions.
When communal liberties were finally proclaimed,
a new culture was inaugurated, and with it a
new epoch in the history of Roman law. The university
of Bologna became the centre for the diffusion and study
of the Pandects, and the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corpus iuris</span></i> became speedily
regarded as the primary and perennial source of common
law in our country. The tradition, according to which
the Pandects of Amalfi, carried off by the Pisans, were
by them discovered and made known for the first time to
the Western world, dates this event about the year 1135,
that is to say in the same age that witnessed the rise of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
the communes, and in which, as related by another tradition,
Guarnerius founded the Bolognese school at the
request of Countess <span class="locked">Matilda.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></span> Thus our conclusions are
supported alike by history, legend, and logic.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>In Italy, therefore, at the beginning of the Middle
Ages, the family accorded a preference to the agnates,
and, in consequence of the continuous weakening of the
State, was obliged to seek in itself for increased strength.
The inroads of the barbarians brought with them a
different constitution of the family, but this could effect
no great change in our own family system until the
Longobards had firmly established their dominion over
us. There then began a great change in the social condition
of Italy, which was forcibly compelled to assume a
form more or less barbaric. Hence it concerns us to study
the Longobard family system, that we may see how far
and in what way it could thus alter ours.</p>

<div id="ip_388" class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;">
<img src="images/i_439.jpg" width="405" height="506" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><p>ANCIENT SHRINE, RAVENNA.</p></div>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 388.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>Like every other barbaric society, that of the Longobards
was founded upon force; in time of war it was
compactly united under a king; during peace it split into
groups, from want of vigour in the central authority,
and from the excessive independence of subordinate chiefs.
Hardly had barbarian kingdoms begun to be erected in
the West with a certain degree of stability, than we find
them subdividing into marquisates, dukedoms, separate
groups, and at a later period into feudal holdings. If
we look to the primitive conditions of these barbarians
before they come among us, we find them scattered over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
the country, without any city properly so-called, and with
no true conception of the State, which for them seems to
consist in a confederation of secondary groups. The social
unity of the barbarians is to be found in the villages or
even in the tribes, which are societies originally derived
perhaps from a single family. Everywhere the State assumes
family forms. The social strength of the Germans
is more manifest in the lesser groups, and consequently in
the family. We ought not to be surprised, therefore, at
finding the family constituted more solidly with them than
among the Latins, who now, for many centuries, had been
altering and modifying it under the growing pressure of
State control.</p>

<p>Originally the barbarian family had been, like the
Roman, an association consecrated by religion. A tutelary
goddess presided over the domestic hearth; the father was
priest and protector of the family. In Rome the control
was in the hand of a single person, who ruled with an
iron authority, but in Germany this authority was shared
by all male members of the family fit to bear arms. At
Rome the family was an absolute monarchy, its senior
members being always regarded as the most powerful; but
in Germany it more resembled a Republic, consisting of
all the adult male members, except such as were disqualified
by bodily infirmity. The family council aided the Roman
father and tempered his rigid despotism; whereas in Germany
the council predominated and assumed to itself the
chief share of the family power. The Roman father
could rupture every domestic tie at his will; he could
remove his son from the family, sell him, or put him to
death. The German son, on the contrary, when able to
bear arms and fight by his father's side, might, if he chose,
separate himself from his original family and join another
tribe. Among the Germans bodily strength, property
held in common, and natural ties of blood constituted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
family; in Rome it was the conception of the family in
itself that dominated over everything and made it authoritative
and sacred. In Rome the individual was merged
in the State, the son in the father; whereas, among the
Germanic tribes, individual liberty was much greater, and
if to us the State has the appearance of a confederation,
the family seems a society of more independent members
united by mutual agreement. Punishments, transgressions,
property, all were in common; if any member of the
family suffered wrong, it was the kinsmen's part to avenge
him and obtain retribution. For sales and donations, as
well as for acts of revenge, the consent of every member
was required, inasmuch as the property belonged to the
whole family, and ought to stay with it: whence the
inutility of testamentary dispositions, which were in fact
unknown to the barbarians. Property was sacred; it
constituted the family, conferred social rights and obligations,
and rested chiefly in the hands of the males. In
this family, and in this society founded wholly on force,
the woman, being incapable of bearing arms, was committed,
like all other weaklings, to the defence and
protection of her armed kinsmen, and so came under their
perpetual guardianship (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">munt</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">manus</span></i>). This
tutelage being established on account of the weakness and
infirmity of the sex, could never come to an end, as it
might in Rome, where it had been constituted wholly in
the interest of the family. But the Germanic woman,
although oppressed, liable to be deprived of her property,
to be sold, or made a slave, was under a power which,
being divided among many, was feebler and less despotic
than the Roman domestic rule. She was a dependent
member of the family, but the authority of her father,
brothers, or sons was shared by all her other kinsmen.
Hence it was easy for the woman to find a protector.
Her incapacity by reason of her infirmity did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
entail incapacity in the eye of the law. She could
appear in court, choose some one to represent her there;
she could own property; she could inherit, although
taking a less share than would have come to her had
she been a man. The man listened to her advice, and
treated her with religious respect; but it was the respect
due to her weaker sex, not as in Rome, where respect was
offered to the mother, to the wife, to the sacred character
which was the foundation at once of the Roman family
and of Roman greatness.</p>

<p>Longobard law, essentially Germanic, prevailed long in
Italy, where plain traces of its survival are to be recognised
as late as the fourteenth century. Under the
stronger influence of the Roman jurisprudence it very
soon lost its native rudeness and originality. As to this
change, Gans, in his "History of the Law of Succession,"
has observed: "The fact that after the historical redaction
of this law, another and systematic compilation of it was
made, should prove to us how it was that the more
confused, but at the same time more natural, spontaneous,
and vigorous character of the Germanic law must necessarily
have been altered, and as it were crystallised into a
form that rather belongs to the Roman." It was precisely
this form that so greatly promoted its diffusion among us.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>With the Longobards, as with all the Germanic nations,
woman was never released from tutelage (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i>), never
became her own mistress (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">selbmundia</span></i>). The man who
desired to make her his wife must first of all pay the
price of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i> or guardianship which the marriage
would give him over her; next he must bind himself to
make good the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">meta</span></i>, a species of dowry noticed by Tacitus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
when he remarks that, among the Germans, the husband
brought the dower to the wife, instead of the wife bringing
it to the husband. To the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">meta</span></i>, also known afterwards
under the name of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">dotalitium</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">dos</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sponsalicium</span></i>, &amp;c., there
was added the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">faderfium</span></i>, which the father might, if he
chose, give to his daughter. On the morning of the day
after the wedding the husband presented his bride with a
gift (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">morgengab</span></i>), attended, according to a very questionable
interpretation, as the price of her virginity. When
Longobard customs came to be affected by the growing
influence of the Roman law, the amount of the <i><span xml:lang="de" lang="la">meta</span></i> and
of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">morgengab</span></i> was restricted. In the age of the communes,
the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">faderfium</span></i>, now transformed into a dower, was
also limited by law. The <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">meta</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">faderfium</span></i>, and <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">morgengab</span></i>
belonged to the wife, who could require them to be given
up to her on her husband's death. But by a peculiarity
of the Germanic law, retained in its entirety even by the
Longobards, the Roman regulation, which made the dower
the separate and independent property of the wife [even
during her husband's lifetime], was never accepted. The
only property owned absolutely and exclusively by the
woman was what was given her by the husband. The
Germanic law favoured the principle of common ownership.
As to this, Gans observes:&mdash;"It is not necessary
with us, as with the Romans, that a woman should have
separate property of her own in order to assert her juridical
personality, and prove her equality with her husband.
She possesses what her husband possesses, and her equality
rests on the mutual affection which makes all differences
disappear." In the ordeal by combat the husband represented
the wife, since she was under the protection of his
sword; if she were taken in adultery he might put her
to death. All her possessions, movable or immovable,
including even nuptial gifts made to her by friends, became
the property of her husband, who had only to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
against the contingency of the marriage being dissolved
by death: whence the necessity of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">meta</span></i> and the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">donatium</span></i>.</p>

<p>If the wife died without issue, everything went to the
husband; on the husband's death, the wife was entitled
to receive the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">meta</span></i> and <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">morgengab</span></i> (donation). For anything
more she was entirely dependent on the generosity
of her husband, who, at a later period, was permitted to
leave her the half, and, eventually, the whole usufruct of
his possessions.</p>

<p>While the marriage laws of the Longobards and the
Romans differed thus widely, their laws relating to
guardianship were also different. The <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i> of the
Longobards, as we have seen, is not to be confounded
with the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">tutela</span></i> to which the Roman woman was subjected.
Originating in the incapacity to bear arms, it was
of limited duration in the case of males, and ceased with
their incapacity. At first the limit was fixed at the age
of twelve, at a later period of eighteen years. But for
the woman, who could never become capable of bearing
arms, it was perpetual. From the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i> of her father,
she passed, on marriage, under that of her husband; and
on the death of her father, if then a widow, under the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i> of her own son, or of the agnates, who were also
her heirs.</p>

<p>In default of other guardians she was protected by the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Curtis Regia</span></i>. But in every case, whether under father,
husband, son, agnates, or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Curtis Regia</span></i>, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i> was
identical in character, having for its object the protection
of the weak. This could not be said of the Roman <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">tutela</span></i>,
which had its origin in the Roman conception of the
family. The <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">tutela</span></i> of the Roman father over his children
lasted all his life; but he could divest himself of it. The
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i> of the Longobard father lasted while his children
were incapable of bearing arms, and, as a logical consequence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
ceased when the incapacity terminated. While
it cannot be positively asserted that emancipation was
unknown to the Longobards, it may be believed, from the
tendency of their law, to have been of rare occurrence.
When the Roman woman was subjected to the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">potestas</span></i>
of her father, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">manus</span></i> of her husband, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">tutela</span></i> of the
agnates, there were three kinds of guardianship very
different from each other, corresponding with the difference
in the domestic relations of those who exercised the
right. No one of them had anything in common with
the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i>.</p>

<p>The Longobard father had the right to sell his sons;
he represented them in courts of law; whatever they
acquired was his. But, as we have already shown, his
authority was tempered by the family council, in which
the brothers of the mother&mdash;the children's natural protectress&mdash;had
much to say.</p>

<p>The Longobard family law has marked peculiarities in
regard to succession as well as to marriage. And first, it
should be noted that the disposal of property by will was
recognised by the Longobards. This seems contrary to
the usage of the Germanic tribes, among whom wills were
unknown, but may be referred to the modifying action
of the Roman on the Longobard law.</p>

<p>The fact, however, that with the Longobards donations
and wills were irrevocable, indicates a Germanic character,
or rather the trace of it, for the main feature of the Roman
will consisted in its revocability. Of the essential principles
of the Roman <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Testamenti factio</span></i> the Longobards
were ignorant. Legitimate children came first in the
order of inheritance, and with them came natural children
also, the latter&mdash;though not in strictness forming part of
the family&mdash;being admitted to succeed along with the
former, though taking a less share. They might, however,
be put on an equal footing by being legitimated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
At a later period this essentially Germanic peculiarity of
the laws of succession was done away with by the action
of the Roman and Canon laws, which exclude natural
children. Originally, by the Longobard law, a legitimate
child took two-thirds of the inheritance, leaving one-third
only to the natural children. If there were two legitimate
children, the natural children took only a fifth; if
three, a seventh.</p>

<p>It was forbidden to leave more than the prescribed
share to natural children, and no child could be disinherited
without just and manifest cause. The reasons for
disinheriting a child were borrowed from the Roman
code. It was allowable, however, to favour one son more
than the rest.</p>

<p>The preference accorded to males over females is a
point of much importance, and is another of the special
characteristics of the Longobard law. When the testator
had one son and one or more unmarried daughters he was
obliged to leave a fourth of the inheritance to the latter,
but when there were several sons the daughters only
received a seventh part. Married daughters had no right
to any share in the inheritance, but had to be content
with what they had received on the day of their marriage,
and could claim nothing more. Failing male issue,
daughters were next heirs, and whether married or
single inherited as though they were males. Another
peculiarity of Longobard law was the great favour shown
to daughters or sisters of the testator domiciled in his
house&mdash;<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">in capillo</span></i>. A brother is excluded in favour of a
daughter or niece&mdash;a remarkable instance of this strange
and singular preference accorded to females. We likewise
find that unmarried daughters and sisters inherit on
equal terms when living under the parental or fraternal
roof.</p>

<p>We have already noticed that the statutes of the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
communes accord, as does also the Longobard law, a
decided preference to <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">agnates</span></i> over <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">cognates</span></i>, and that this
circumstance has given rise to keen discussion. Many
persons, indeed, insist on detecting in this preference an
absolutely Germanic characteristic transfused into the
statutes from the Longobard law. But we have seen
that through the greater part of its history the Roman
law also gave a preference to the agnates, and that it was
only at a very late period that it lost this feature, which
was still to some extent retained in Italy at the time of the
barbarian invasions. That the preference of the agnates
was not borrowed by the statutes from the Longobard
law will be even more conclusively shown if we consider
the manifest differences which prevail on this very point
between the Germanic and the Italian laws; and bear in
mind the important fact that the preference continued to
increase in strength, at the very time when the action and
influence of the Roman law are increasingly apparent in
the statutes. In truth, the more closely we examine the
matter, the more we are compelled to recognise that it
was political reasons altogether peculiar to the Italian
communes and to Italian society in the Middle Ages
that led to this preference of the agnates. But even here
the reciprocal action of the one law upon the other is
clearly traceable, for we can perceive that the succession
of the agnates, under the Longobard law, has itself been
modified by the Roman, which has made it careless of the
nature of the property of which the inheritance consists;
whereas it is the peculiar and constant characteristic of
the Germanic law that such succession should be ruled
according both to the degree of kinship and the nature
of the inheritance.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be said generally that with the
Longobards the ties of blood predominate; that in their
family there is greater individual freedom, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
family itself is much less affected by the action of the
State. With the Romans, on the contrary, the conception
of the family is stronger than the ties of blood; the unity
of the family depends at first on an absolute paternal
despotism, afterwards destroyed by the authority of the
State, which to a great extent assumes its place.</p>

<p>From this time the State is predominant in all things;
it reduces the family to fragments, and aims at the complete
equality of all without having the strength to
consolidate a society in which neither individual liberty,
local activity, nor free associations were allowed sufficient
scope for their development. Yet all these were absolutely
necessary for the preservation of a huge social
structure made up of distinct races, and consequently
destitute of the national character and unity which the
Republic and the Empire had imposed. It was precisely
these new elements that were introduced among us by
the barbarians. And thus it was that two peoples, two
forms of family and society, I might almost say two ideas,
two wholly different types of society were brought
together, of which the one had become the necessary
complement of the other. From their forests the Germans
brought individual freedom, personal independence, the
force of small associations; the Latins had already discovered
the unity of the State, the wider and more
organic conception of society, and the political idea of
the family which we shall see hereafter triumphing in the
Commune.</p>

<p>From the fusion of these two different societies that
modern society is to arise in which the action of the
one is seldom dissociated from that of the other, and it
becomes impossible to ascribe the result exclusively to
either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>But while the co-existing and contending laws of the
Romans and Longobards are the two juridical elements
most plainly to be recognised in the Italian statutes, there
are others also claiming remembrance, and among these
the feudal and the Canon law must be noticed. Feudalism
is one of the most important institutions in the history of
the Middle Ages; it is the first form that society assumes
on emerging from the chaos of barbarism, and it is stamped
with a character essentially Germanic. With it, property
and the family take a new and peculiar shape. We may
pronounce it to be the first and chief political and social
manifestation of Germanic individualism. The barbarian
tribe had a natural tendency to split into small groups,
into families solely united by the bond of common danger.
During invasions the tribe transformed itself into an
armed band, left behind all weak or incapable members,
accepted recruits even from neighbouring tribes, and being
under the command of one chief, was forced by the exigencies
of war to be firmly and compactly united. The
attacks previously made on them by the Romans had,
for like reasons, the effect of creating among the barbarians
certain strong and powerful kingdoms by the
union of different tribes; but these never lasted long,
since as soon as peace was restored they began anew to
fall apart and dissolve. Scarcely had the barbarians begun
to settle themselves in the West, than their incapacity to
establish the unity of a State was made clearly manifest.
The moment peace was declared the leaders of the
various armed bands proceeded to divide the conquered
territory. They then separated, and their king, or
supreme chief, remained, as it were, isolated, and with
very scant authority. Every leader tried to possess himself
of some stronghold where he might rule as an absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
lord, barely acknowledging his dependence on the
king. In the fief thus created, ownership and sovereignty
became confused, but were both considered to be held
(<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">per beneficium</span></i>) as of favour from a more powerful lord,
subject to certain burthens and obligations. Originally a
temporary grant, the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">benefice</span></i> or <i>fief</i> only became hereditary
at a later time. At first it could be resumed by the
donor; it reverted to him on the death of the feudatory,
that it might be transmitted by a new grant to the
feudatory's heirs; it then gradually, by use, abuse, or
special act of concession, became an hereditary estate.
Eventually all property, possession, or ownership came
to be held, during the Middle Ages, on feudal tenure.
The want of vigour in the supreme political power
obliged the weak to seek protection elsewhere. Many
independent landowners voluntarily accepted the position
of vassals; while, on the other hand, the obstacles encountered
by the great lords in enforcing their authority
over wide territories compelled them to cede part of their
land in <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">benefice</span></i> to lesser vassals. In this way the State,
the Church, all things assumed a feudal form. This
system was completely established in the eleventh century,
when the communes arose in Italy to combat and overthrow
it.</p>

<p>In a fortified castle it was natural that the ties of the
family should become continually stronger: a fortress
must suffice for itself. It was, as it were, the independent
world of the lord who dwelt in it, and divided his time
between perilous adventures and domestic life. All historians
have noted that feudalism produced increased
respect, affection, and chivalrous regard for woman, and
made man more resolute and energetic. Save in times of
war, the baron was almost absolute and independent lord
of his small realm, wherein all were his subjects. From
him his vassals received the posts of seneschal, count of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
the palace, equerry, and the like, which offices, being
granted in a form more or less feudal to persons of noble
birth, had a tendency to become hereditary. A numerous
retinue somewhat relieved the loneliness of the castle.
The sons of subordinate nobles frequented the court of
their liege lord, to be trained to polite manners and the
arts of chivalry, and finally to receive the sword from his
hands and be proclaimed knights. All this gave prestige
to the castle, and secured the fidelity of the vassals to
their lord, while at the same time it flattered the pride of
the inferior nobility.</p>

<p>The Longobard feudal law is found to have points of
connection with the laws of Rome which, though very
different in spirit, are often called to its aid. Often,
however, they are found to be in opposition. There can
be no doubt that the Roman law manifests in Italy its
persistent action on the feudal law. The fief, as is well
known, not being absolute independent property, but only
a limited and conditional grant, cannot, from its nature, be
subject to the hereditary principle. On the contrary, the
right of the heir must be recognised anew in his person,
since, as we have seen, he does not derive it from any
right in his predecessor. And this continued to be the
practice even after custom had begun to make the tenure
hereditary. According to feudal law, the successor was
not then considered to represent the person whose heir he
was; the original grant was renewed in his behalf. Moreover,
when a fief has once become hereditary, the whole
family has a right to it, not derived from the will of the
last holder at his death, but already existent during his
life. It is therefore necessary to establish an order of
succession to determine which member of the family shall
be preferred, and this order of succession begins to be
borrowed from the Roman code. Although differing
from the true and correct order of succession, it is gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
confounded with it, and finally alters and dissolves the
fief. Thus the Roman law penetrates and modifies the
feudal.</p>

<div id="ip_401" class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_454.jpg" width="400" height="530" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><p>CHURCH OF SAN VITALE, RAVENNA.</p></div>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 401.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>From the very nature of a fief, female descendants
cannot inherit, and the male descendants of deceased sons
succeed equally with surviving sons. Nevertheless there
are certain fiefs which, having been originally bestowed
upon females, must, in default of heirs male, naturally
pass to females; but as soon as the male line is established,
male heirs have the preference. Ascendants cannot
succeed, because succession is determined, not by relationship,
but by the original grant; accordingly the reversion
falls, not to the ascendant, but to the original granter of
the fief. Collaterals of the last holder, unless descendants
of the first, are not entitled to succeed; nor can brothers,
as such, succeed, unless their father has held the fief. Nor
can husband and wife succeed to each other. But under
the growing influence of common law all these primitive
characteristics likewise disappear. Feudal law has little
importance in the Italian statutes; but the political and
social importance of feudalism in the history of our communes
is immense. It represents a society distinguished
by laws and usages of its own, and that appeals to the
Emperor, whose judgments and judges it always prefers
to the laws and magistrates of the Republic which it
despises, and would fain ignore. The Republic in consequence
looks on the nobility as a foe to be destroyed, but
this it can only effect after sanguinary struggles in the
course of which it will be itself profoundly changed.</p>

<p>Canon law undoubtedly plays a part in the history and
formation of the communes that should not be overlooked,
though by no means corresponding with the greatness of
the political, social, and religious influence of the Church.
Made up of fragments from the writings of the Fathers,
ordinances of ecclesiastical councils, papal decretals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
with a large admixture of Roman law, it appeals also to
the authority of reason and of Holy Writ. It thus
declared itself favourable to natural equity, as opposed to
legal sophistry, tempered the harshness of barbaric laws,
protected the weak, upheld the sanctity of the family, and
aided the triumph of the Roman law over that of the
Longobards. But it also sought to subordinate the civil
power to the ecclesiastical; it added to the number of
exceptional tribunals; it favoured inquisitorial jurisdiction,
torture, and trial by ordeal. Moreover, its constant tendency
to encroach on the field of civil law found an open
door in the oath which every magistrate, the Podestà
included, had to take, with the prescribed formula:
"saving conscience" (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">salva la coscienza</span></i>) expressed or
understood. As it rested with the clergy to determine
cases of conscience, so also it was for them to decide on
the validity of oaths. This naturally fostered the diffusion
of canon law. The exclusion of natural children
from succession and the suppression of divorce are not a
little due to the operation of this law. Its action is to be
seen plainly enough in the statutes, but still more clearly
in the struggle between the civil authority and the ecclesiastical,
wherein the latter endeavours to maintain its
inviolable privileges, its exceptional tribunals, its supremacy
even in causes civil and political.</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>In the statutes therefore, we find four different legislations,
contending, as it were, with one another: the
Longobard, the Roman, the Feudal and the Canon law.
These, however, may almost be reduced to two, seeing
that feudal law is Germanic, and canon law, in so far as it
affects the statutes, is mainly Roman. So that here again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
we are met by the old hostility between Germans and Latins.
The two races are opposed, as also their institutions,
laws, and ideas; their minds seem to challenge one
another wherever they meet, whether in the field of letters,
politics, or art. Yet each has need of the other, and both
must disappear to make way for a new social system and
a more comprehensive spirit which, resulting from the
fusion of two warring elements, will remain sole victor in
this prolonged contest. In Italy, however, the Latin
strain always predominates, as we see even in the statutes,
wherein Roman law forms the keystone of the whole
juridical structure.</p>

<div id="ip_403" class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/i_458.jpg" width="338" height="509" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><p>EMPEROR JUSTINIAN.</p>

<p>(<i>From a Mosaic, Ravenna.</i>)</p></div>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 403.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>The earliest compilation of the statutes dates from the
very time when a knowledge of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corpus iuris</span></i> begins to
be diffused throughout Italy from the University of
Bologna. From that time forth the legislation of Justinian
was regarded as an epitome of juridical philosophy,
as the law <i><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</span></i>, and is recognised by all our Republics
as the common law, the law to be applied whenever
the statutes are silent. For this reason that part of the
statutes which relates to the civil law is very much less
developed than the political part; and for this reason
those teachers whose studies have been directed chiefly to
civil jurisprudence occupy themselves much more with
Roman, canon, feudal, and Longobard law than with the
law of the statutes. These they examined, especially at
first, rather as a result of the study of the Roman law,
than as deserving careful attention on their own account;
they regarded them as the written expression of popular
custom to which no great scientific value could be attached,
as something outside the one legal system which alone
merited universal admiration.</p>

<p>A long period elapsed before writers on law began to apply
their minds to the consideration of the statutes, the great
importance of which has been only completely recognised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
in our day. Venice is perhaps the only Commune in
which it was customary, in the absence of statutory provisions,
to appeal to natural reason: whence Bartolo's
remark that the Venetian magistrate gave judgment <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">manu
regia et arbitrio suo</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> But even in Venice such decisions
must always have been inspired or guided by a knowledge
and admiration of the Roman law.</p>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 404.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>What has been said will put in a clear light the extraordinary
importance accorded to the University and the
professors of Bologna in connection with their labours in
annotating and interpreting the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corpus iuris</span></i> so as to
make it intelligible to all, and an instrument for instructing
and training all those who sought to follow the legal
profession, whether as notaries, judges, Podestàs, or captains
of the people. That these teachers possessed a very
slender knowledge of history is seen from their writings.
Their merit lay in the intelligent exposition of a system
of law which had never become extinct. It was a precept
of theirs that "as the unskilled rider must hold on by
the pommel, so the judge should stick to the gloss." In
this way the school of Bologna became, as it were, the
depository of an universal law which was looked upon as
almost sacred. Thither popes sent their decretals,
emperors their edicts for registry or revision. The
Emperor was, however, regarded as the living source of
legislation, as alone entitled to add new laws to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
Roman. Any one speaking evil of the Emperor met
with condign punishment. Any one who questioned his
universal authority was declared heretical by the jurists
themselves. This authority belonged to him as lord of
all nations, and was transmitted to him from the Roman
Empire as its rightful heir. It was natural, therefore, that
to determine the extent and limits of this authority,
recourse should again be had to the professors of Bologna,
the veritable depositaries of the Roman law, who accordingly
acquired a constantly increasing importance. The
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ratio scripta</span></i> was what was always called for; and the
communes, even while avowing their determination to
preserve their ancient liberties undiminished, never forgot
to profess their willingness to leave the Emperor all the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">veteres justitias</span></i> which belonged to him, and which they
declared themselves desirous to respect. The only question
was to ascertain what these were, and hence fresh
occasion to consult the professors of Bologna.</p>

<p>Before the great contest between the Lombards and
Frederic Barbarossa, a genuine judicial trial was held,
ending with the condemnation of the Milanese, who were
declared rebels, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">adstipulantibus judicibus et primis de
Italia</span></i>. At Roncaglia, Frederic exercised judicial and
legislative authority, with the assistance of four professors
from Bologna, who maintained the Emperor's rights, not
from any hostility to their own country, but because, as
professors of Roman law, they were the natural champions
of the Holy Roman Empire. Nor did the communes
themselves raise any objection to these claims. After
Frederic's defeat they continued to draw up their statutes,
laws, and public instruments in his name. Even as late
as the fifteenth century, we find that notaries still gave
validity to public documents by making them run in the
name of the Empire. At the peace of Constance the
power to appoint magistrates, civil and criminal, consuls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
Podestà, and notaries, was expressly reserved to the
Emperor, whose prerogative in such matters, as well as of
deciding causes of serious importance on final appeal, was
fully recognised. If, in fact, the Milanese paid little
regard to the Emperor's authority, his right was not
questioned. The Lombards acknowledged themselves his
lawful subjects, though they afterwards chose to act as
if free and independent.</p>

<p>When Henry VII. came to Italy, in Dante's time, he
too, brought the Italian cities to trial, pronounced sentence
on them, exacted fines on men and money, and cited
King Robert of Naples to appear before him. At that
time many must have deemed these proceedings farcical;
but they were echoes of a bygone age, of a past which
even Alighieri's immortal genius thought to recall to life,
as his letters and his book, "De Monarchia," serve to
show. The Church, it is true, constantly withstood the
Empire, but during the whole of the Middle Ages the
Emperor's political and juridical authority was never called
in question, was invariably recognised.</p>

<p>While the continual struggle between Church and
Empire, communes and feudal lords, Guelphs and Ghibellines,
was being waged, the statutes were framed. In
these were recorded, not only new customs written down
as they were formed, but also all the old customs that had
been modified by the new. Although the jurists of Bologna
thought it no concern of theirs to study a system of law,
which being in common use was then well known, and
which had its source in that Roman jurisprudence which
engaged their attention through their whole lives, for us
it is certainly a study of grave importance, as a means
of accurately estimating the value and character of this
communal life in the Middle Ages. We may have very
long to wait before we can completely solve the problem.
Nevertheless we may make a beginning by examining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
various statutes, comparing them with one another, and
also comparing the different forms which each of them
received at different stages of drafting, in order to discern
the evolution of the new law, to ascertain and understand
the principle which governs it.</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>The whole life of the Commune is embraced in the
statutes: the election and functions of political magistrates;
public, civil, criminal, administrative, and commercial
law. Public law is the subject most fully dealt
with; while, for reasons already explained, civil law is left
very incomplete. Nevertheless the statutes handle, with
more or less detail, such matters as personal <i>status</i>,
dowers, contracts, judicial procedure, succession, wills,
rights arising in respect of contiguous lands or houses,
and, above all, the family. They aim at a simple and
summary procedure, free from chicanery, whereby causes
may be settled fairly and promptly; but from defective
drafting, from admitting a running commentary, altogether
out of place in legal enactments, and from leaving too
much to the discretion of the judge, they generally lead
to a contrary result. It is indeed astonishing to observe
how, during those centuries in which a splendid literature
was growing up, when the most unpretentious writings
offer us an example of good style, and when judges,
notaries, and professors of law had the imperishable
model of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Corpus iuris</span></i> constantly before their eyes,
the statutes should have been written in a form so illiterate
that we may often pronounce it barbarous, and
always involved and confused. The statutes constitute a
legislation based upon custom, mutable, popular, still
uncertain of itself, which, taking its birth in the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
civil wars, always retained their likeness, and never arrived
at classical elegances, which in any case would have been
made impossible by the scholastic jargon that still prevailed
in our Universities and among our jurists. Petrarch's
animadversions, directed chiefly against the obscure
phraseology of the professors of law in his time, were fully
justified. The classical revival which sought to introduce
a purer and more elegant latinity had to make a beginning
outside, and often in opposition to the Universities. It
spread far and wide during the fifteenth century, but
always retained a literary and philosophical rather than a
juridical character.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the greatness of its merits and aims, the
Italian Commune has in it something of the transitory and
mediæval; it constantly indicates a period of change. It
is the germ from which, at a later time, modern society is
to issue, but the birth cannot be accomplished until the
germ itself is destroyed; consequently it always remained
in a state of incessant transformation. Sprung from the
conjunction of two different societies, the Roman and
Germanic, it derived from the former the general idea of
the State, from the latter individual liberty, local activity,
and the force of special associations. The problem it had
to solve, and that constitutes its essential life and history,
lies precisely in its ceaseless efforts to harmonise those two
elements which long remained not only separate but often
opposed. Until complete fusion was effected by the
destruction of the Commune itself, the contest continued
to be waged, and was accompanied by inevitable disorder.
In the Commune, government and public policy have an
importance unknown to barbaric society, but the Commune
still wears the character of a powerful assemblage of
small associations rather than of a single society, or of a
State in the true and strict sense of the word. Life indeed
courses more swiftly through these numberless groups,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
and is quickened by their activity. Social vigour is chiefly
to be looked for in family cliques, and in the Companies
of the Arts and Trades, of the Nobles and of the Burghers,
all of whom have laws, statutes, magistrates, and tribunals
of their own. Hence arises an extraordinary interlacing
of ordinances, of conflicting passions, of diverging or
clashing interests. True individual liberty, true equality
before the law is not yet understood; but the individual
is trained and protected by the association to which he
belongs, which lends him a certain degree of strength, and
secures him an increasing share of freedom. These subsidiary
groups, however, unlike those which we have
already met with in the Germanic societies, cannot be
separated, but must live together in the State, outside of
which there is no reason for their existence. The infinite
multiplication of these groups, their jealousies and continual
jarrings and collisions, made the Republic all the
more indispensable to them, all the more the object of
their hopes and love. Every one of these merchant-citizens
was ready to give his life for this Republic, on
which, both in peace and in war, his own welfare and that
of the various associations depended. The heads and
leading members of these associations were privileged to
sit in the Councils of the State, governed it as masters,
and found it their only sure defence against the countless
rivals with whom each of them had to contend. Individual
and general interests thus worked in concert, and
the fragmentary power divided among so many hands,
was nevertheless able to guard the liberty of all, at a time
when no true conception of the State or of general
equality had yet arisen. Still, it is easy to imagine how
ill-arranged and inconclusive must have been the legislation
of republics thus divided and subdivided, in which
at every step some new special statute or tribunal was
encountered. And this at a time when judicial and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
political power were so strangely intermixed, that whoever
had a share in the one necessarily shared in the other.</p>

<p>The dominant feature in all the civil enactments of the
statutes seems to be a jealousy of neighbouring communes,
and a fear lest, as a result of marriage, property should be
withdrawn from the city, the society, or the family. To
guard against this, both law and custom provided so efficaciously,
that even in a Republic as democratic as that
of Florence, wherein every vestige of aristocracy was
destroyed, and the Ciompi obtained the upper hand, we
find landed property so strictly tied up that there are
families who, to this day, own the same estates which were
held by their ancestors in the fourteenth century. The
necessity for keeping families, associations, and party-circles
intimately united, and making each member of
them bound for the rest, is so strikingly apparent, that it
is these political and social considerations which determine
the tendency of the civil law, and often impede its natural
development. So that even here, notwithstanding the
weakness of the State, we again recognise the old Latin
tradition, which always accords an excessive importance to
political considerations, and consequently a preponderating
influence to public over private law. The Italian statutes,
therefore, can only be explained and understood in connection
with the history of the communes, which they
illustrate in their turn. And this is another reason why
the professors of Bologna, accustomed to the philosophical
character of Justinian's legislation, and unfamiliar with
the methods of historical exposition, so long neglected the
statutes.</p>

<p>Also, as might be expected, the predominating action
of political considerations is most clearly shown in the
constitution of the family. Here the rights which flow
from the Commune's conception of the family prevail
over the ties of blood which by the Germanic law are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
much more respected. The regulations of the Roman
law as to dower are fully accepted, but the dower itself is
restricted to a small amount. Males have a marked precedence
over females, and over descendants in the female
line. But in all circumstances the woman is entitled to
alimony. It is not meant that she should be rich, or
should divide the domestic patrimony, and transfer it to
another family, much less to another Commune; but in
any event she must be assured of a suitable maintenance,
according to her rank of life. She remains under the
perpetual protection of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">mondualdo</span></i> (legal guardian),
but the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i> assumes in the statutes the character of
the later Roman <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">tutela</span></i>, with which it almost seems to be
confounded. The woman may call upon the judge to
assign her a <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">mondualdo</span></i>, and may choose him herself when
she requires him for any special business. Everywhere,
indeed, we see this tendency to transform Longobard
institutions into Roman, so that often nothing is left to
the former save the name.</p>

<p>Immovable property was so strictly settled that a very
small part of it could be disposed of by the father at his
death. No one, therefore, born of a family in easy circumstances
was exposed to any anxiety as to his future.
It is to be noted, however, that in our communes, all of
which resembled great commercial houses, the proportion
of immovable to movable property was extremely small;
and that if, as regards the former, there was much
security and stability, for the latter there were rapid gains,
unforeseen fortunes, and sudden fluctuations of capital.</p>

<p>The father's authority was held in veneration, and the
utmost confidence reposed in guardians of his choice;
but we do not find in the statutes any great development
of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">patria potestas</span></i>. On the contrary, as in other cities,
the marked characteristic of the family is their doing
everything in common. All affairs of moment are settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
by the family council, by an assembly of relations. Both
law and custom continue to follow this course. In the
family, the party-circle, or <i>clique</i>, and the association, the
community of interests is sometimes carried to extraordinary
lengths. Not only may a father or brother be
summoned to pay the debts of a son or brother, but
every creditor of a consociation can sue its individual
members, and one associate may be made liable even for
the crimes of another. Within the circle of the family or
association, disputes were settled by arbiters, whose awards
had the validity of legal sentences. The trade associations,
as we have already stated, had regularly constituted,
special tribunals of their own. These incidents
and characteristics of statutory law certainly cannot be
referred to the Roman legislation, but find their explanation
in the very beginnings of Italian history to which
Germanic races and institutions undoubtedly contributed
in no small degree. The distinctive character of the
Commune remains always the same. On the one hand
particular associations attain great development; on the
other the action of the political power is sometimes too
feeble, but at times exercises a pressure such as would
seem excessive even at this day. In a society in which
the State is so feeble that its very existence seems continually
threatened, it is certainly strange to find it interfering
so directly and extensively in the private affairs of
the citizens. The emancipation of sons is to be effected
with due solemnity at a full meeting of the Council of
the People, in the presence of the heads of the Republic.
Should a noble citizen desire to change his abode and
move to another quarter of the city, the matter must be
brought before the same Councils of the People and the
Commune, and decided by a special <span class="locked">Act.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></span> We find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
chief magistrates of the Florentine commonwealth continually
altering the boundaries and extent of the Quartieri
or Sestieri of the city, enlarging or contracting now one
and now another in order to preserve the balance which is
always being threatened by parties and sects, and prevent
any one quarter from winning undue predominance. A
change of abode from one district of the town to another
might drag a citizen into a different sect or party, and so
become of political importance. All this shows more and
more clearly that society had not yet found its natural
and permanent basis. The manifold new and varied
elements entering into its composition were being developed
on all sides; but the synthetic power which
unites and assimilates could never be attained by the
Italian Commune.</p>

<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>Coming now to a particular examination of the statutory
provisions which most nearly concern the subject in hand,
we shall direct our attention more especially to the Florentine
statutes which, for us, have a twofold importance.
We have undertaken this study as an aid to the clearer
comprehension of certain political reforms in Florence,
which are only to be explained by the social conditions
of the Republic. In this study of the Florentine Commune
it is necessary to bear in mind that in no other
Commune was aristocracy so radically destroyed and
democracy so thoroughly triumphant. Every trace of
feudalism, every foreign element disappears from its
statute book, which consequently, in spite of perennial
alterations, preserves a uniform and consistent character,
and tends always towards the scope that it finally
attains. Other statute books, on the contrary, are no
less copiously altered; but the alterations are due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
less permanent causes, to elements most extraneous to
the life of the Commune, and which therefore make it
still more difficult to understand what are the true
principles moulding the laws and determining their
historical character.</p>

<p>If we begin by examining the paternal authority as set
forth in the statutes, we at once perceive the uncertainty
that prevails in this legislation. At first we find the
Longobard <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">mundium</span></i>, but this gradually takes the shape
of the Roman <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">patria potestas</span></i>, as regulated by Justinian's
legislation, which finally prevails, although never absolutely.
In the various provisions of the statutes, which,
even on this point, are always defective, we sometimes
find the son placed under a stricter subjection than by
Roman law, while at other times, the Longobard law
predominating, he enjoys the greatest independence.
Generally there are special political or commercial reasons
at the root of this illogical inconsistency. By the Roman
statutes the son is entitled to appear in criminal cases,
without permission from his father, who is not held
liable for crimes committed by his son. The son, however,
may be punished by his parents at their discretion.
The natural children of magnates are in an inferior
position, both civilly and politically, to sons born in wedlock,
inasmuch as they are never eligible to any public
<span class="locked">office.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></span> According to the Pesaro statutes, a son may
dispose by will of all his earnings, provided he leaves
the obligatory usufruct to his father; but sons marrying
without their father's consent may be <span class="locked">disinherited.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></span>
When a son is condemned to pay a fine, the father must
give him his share of the inheritance wherewith to pay it.
Should a father beat his sons or grandsons or their wives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">in nihilo puniatur, nisi pro enormi delicto</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> In Lucca,
a son who is eighteen years of age, may contract a loan,
even without his father's leave. But a father may send
his son, whether emancipated or under tutelage, to
prison if he has dissipated his private means or led an
evil life. The magistrates must execute the father's
decision without calling for <span class="locked">proofs.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></span> A son may thus
be arbitrarily confined to the house, fettered and imprisoned
by his father, who is only bound to supply him
with the necessaries of life. The same rule obtains with
regard to other descendants. If in all this great variety
of laws we try to discover any one characteristic peculiar
to the statutes, we must seek it in the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">unitas personæ</span></i>
between father and son, which is often carried to a great
length. This, too, is a result of the general conception
of the family recognised by the statutes. In Urbino and
elsewhere the father may be punished for the son, the
master for the <span class="locked">servant.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></span> As to the liabilities of commerce,
these are shared, not only by father and son, but
by the whole body of the relations, as we find was the
case in Genoa, Florence, and many of the principal
trading cities. In Florence, the father, grandfather, and
great-grandfather incur the same liability for a descendant
(even if under guardianship) who engages in trade, as
though they stood surety for him. To escape this
responsibility they must make a public and formal disclaimer
of <span class="locked">liability.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></span> Thus, if an unemancipated son is
agent or factor of a company or house of business, the
father is responsible for him, unless he has given the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
parties legal notice to the contrary. For the same reason
the emancipation of the son must be publicly performed
and communicated to the Society of <span class="locked">Merchants.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></span> When
a daughter marries, she ceases to be subject to the
paternal authority, and can no longer be held in any
way responsible for her father, either as regards civil
obligations or criminal, should the father have evaded
punishment by flight.</p>

<p>In Florence, the woman is under the perpetual protection
of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Mondualdo</span></i>. The term was still retained in
the eighteenth century, but under the statutes the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">mundio</span></i>
soon becomes almost identical with the Roman tutelage;
as time goes on it gradually falls into disuse, but the
rights of women are never made equal with those of men.
In respect of marriage the intermixture of different legal
systems is most marked. Professor Gans has noted how
the Pisans, finding that the Roman law forbade a woman
to re-marry within a year from her husband's death, that
the Canon law (interpreting the apostle's words as an
unqualified permission) contained no such prohibition,
and that the Longobard law forbade re-marriage only for
thirty days, fixed by their statutes the prohibited period
at six months. But this rough compromise neither met
the object intended by the Roman law, namely, that a
second marriage should not take place during the pregnancy
which might possibly result from the first, nor
conceded the liberty allowed by the Canon law and the
Longobard. More commonly, however, the union of
different laws is brought about by the gradual transformation
of one into another. The Pisan statutes, for
instance, regulate marriage almost entirely according to
the Roman Code. To the dower (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">dos</span></i>) brought by the
wife, and the donation (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">donatio propter nuptias</span></i>, called
also <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">antefactum</span></i>) given by the husband, they join other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
gifts, to which they give the name "<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">corredo</span></i>," which,
on the dissolution of the marriage, belong to the wife:
should they then be found to have been consumed or
made away with, she would be entitled to two-thirds of
their value. As a rule Pisan husbands and wives hold
their property entirely separate, so that marriage seems
sometimes to involve a hostile relation, rather than a
community of <span class="locked">interests.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></span></p>

<p>Certain statutes admit the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">dos</span></i> and <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">donatio propter
nuptias</span></i> together with the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">meta</span></i> and the Longobard
donation. The Florentine statute speaks of a dowry,
of a donation that must be equal to one half of the
dowry&mdash;provided this does not exceed the sum of fifty
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>&mdash;and of an augmentation. Failing sons, grandsons,
or grandsons of sons, the wife, at her husband's death,
recovered possession of her dowry, with the donation and
augmentation; otherwise she had her dowry alone, and
whatever her husband might leave her by will. If the
husband died before receiving the dowry, the wife took
the promised donation, limited however to one-eighth of
her husband's estate, over which, to the extent of her
dower, she had a preferential mortgage. Nor had the
wife's consent to the sale or alienation of her husband's
property the effect of releasing her right to the subjects so
sold or alienated. This regulation, however, only comes
into force from the year <span class="locked">1388.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></span> This date, which is given
in the printed Florentine statute of 1415, shows that the
dotal system and the separation of property had by this
time made great progress, a fact farther confirmed by the
statutes.</p>

<p>The wife could not maintain her right to her husband's
property (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">defendere bona viri</span></i>) against her husband's
creditors at large, but only against those who were liable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
for the restitution of the dower. Dotal property, of
which no valuation had been made, might be claimed by
her as against any creditor, and if her husband fell into
difficulties, she could always demand restitution of her
<span class="locked">dower.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a></span> Property acquired or inherited by the wife
during the husband's life, belonged to her; but she could
not alienate it without the consent of the husband, who
was also entitled to the usufruct. On the decease of the
husband, whatever remained of the usufruct might be
claimed by the wife, or, if she too were dead, by the
children.</p>

<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>The dotal system and separation of conjugal property
are not only recognised in all the <span class="locked">statutes,<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></span> but are often
enacted in an exaggerated form, as seems to be the case in
the statutes of Pisa. Thus gifts between husband and wife
are forbidden, sometimes even gifts from them to strangers,
where there is ground to suspect that these are meant to
disguise a gift between the spouses. Zealous precautions
to hinder property being withdrawn from the family, still
more from the city, are universal. In Urbino, for instance,
no alien could inherit <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab intestato</span></i>, without first pledging
his word to reside within the city or <span class="locked">territory.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a></span> At Pesaro
a similar pledge was exacted from any alien who sought a
bride in that city; he had also to obtain the consent of
the Podestà.</p>

<p>In <span class="locked">Verona,<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></span> women might, under a will, share equally
with their brothers; but <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab intestato</span></i>, they had only their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
dower. In Pisa, testate succession was regulated in
accordance with the Roman law: <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">de ultimis voluntatibus
pen legem romanum iudicetur</span></i>. The lawful share, however,
was fixed on almost the same scale as by Longobard law;
and, as provided by that law, one child might be favoured
more than the rest. As regards intestate succession,
male heirs had, as always, marked preference. Failing
descendants in the male line, females inherited, but even
in the succession to maternal estate, male descendants had
priority when there were no surviving <span class="locked">daughters.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></span> This
rule prevails in all statute books, not excluding the
"Consuetudini" of Naples, of Amalfi, and of Sorrento,
although in these cities the influence of the Longobard
law was much less <span class="locked">felt.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></span> The real object of these regulations
is clearly expressed in the statutes themselves. In
the statutes of Mantua it is thus set forth: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ut familiarum
dignitas, nomen et ordo serventur, et bona morientium
in eorum agnatos et posteros transmittantur, per
quos nomina generis conservantur, statuimus et ordinamus</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a>
&amp;c.</p>

<p>It would seem that in Ravenna the prolonged continuance
of the Byzantine rule had the effect of suppressing
this preference of the agnates, and that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
the Novel of Justinian was in force. The same was the
case at Osimo. Adoption was of rare occurrence;
legitimated children were postponed to legitimate; natural
children who, under the influence of the Longobard law,
had been favoured in earlier statutes, were afterwards
neglected, in consequence of the growing ascendancy of
Canon and Roman law. The whole statutory law of
succession is so dominated by the political conception
which, so far from losing, is constantly gaining ground,
that the disposing power of the testator&mdash;always extremely
restricted&mdash;can only arrive at a result slightly more equitable
and natural, but never attains to absolute freedom of
decision in the Roman sense of the word. In this, as in
every branch of civil law, the Florentine Statute Book,
like all the others, does not present us with a complete
treatise, but only with fragments, the statutes making
constant reference to the Roman law.</p>

<p>No woman succeeds <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab intestato</span></i> to her sons or
daughters, when there are direct descendants or ascendants
even in the third degree; and uncle, brother,
sister, son, or grandson of a brother are preferred to her.
Though excluded from succession, she can nevertheless
claim alimony from those who by law exclude her. If
there be no such relatives, she inherits <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab intestato</span></i> one-fourth
of her son's estate, provided it does not amount to
more than five hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>. In any case, she only
receives money, not real property. If there is no money,
she will be entitled to the price of the lands forming her
inheritance. The same provisions apply when a grandmother,
great-grandmother, or descendants in the maternal
line succeed <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab intestato</span></i>.</p>

<p>A woman could not succeed <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab intestato</span></i> to a brother
leaving children, grandchildren, or brothers; but when
thus excluded from the succession, she was still entitled to
alimony. She could not succeed even to her father; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
was entitled to receive her dowry from the agnates, and
could meanwhile, even if a widow, claim alimony from
<span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></span></p>

<p>It is plain from all these provisions that the woman's
rights of succession were very limited; but she was
always insured of the wherewithal to live. We find,
indeed, from the Florentine statutes, that while the
preference given to the agnates increases as time goes on,
so too the woman's rights to alimony increase. The
statute of 1355 concedes to her the usufruct of the
paternal inheritance, on failure of male issue, while under
the same circumstances, later statutes deny her this right,
allowing her alimony <span class="locked">instead.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></span> Speaking of aliment, and
of those bound to supply it, the statute of 1324 says:
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Si filius, nepos vel pronepos facultatis abundarent</span>,"<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> so
that they can <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">commode subvenire</span></i>, &amp;c.; and the statute of
1355 imposes the same obligation, with the same <span class="locked">conditions.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></span>
But the printed statute of 1415 is far more
explicit; the father, mother, grandfather, grandmother,
great-grandfather, and great-grandmother are all entitled
to alimony, and the Podestà is bound to enforce the law.
The female inherits <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab intestato</span></i> from her mother or other
female ascendants, but only on failure of male issue.
Uterine brothers, being of the female line, cannot succeed
one another should there be relations of the deceased in
the male line as far as the fourth <span class="locked">degree,<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></span> these being
preferred to the mother and relations in the female line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
The Florentine statute goes on to declare that the wife is
to be preferred to the public treasury, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">uxor mariti defuncti
præferatur fisco</span></i>; showing how little the woman's rights
were considered, when an express enactment was needed
to prevent the revenue authorities from depriving her of
her husband's estate. Natural children were also preferred
to the treasury, which only succeeded on failure of relations
as far as the fourth degree. Relations, however,
could succeed to bastards, as though these had been
<span class="locked">legitimate.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></span> It should be added that Florentine custom
did not allow natural children to be left without some
means of support, or without provision for their education,
as is shown by many still existing wills. In the case of
males, the father generally tried to obtain employment for
them; in the case of females, to find them husbands, and
he recommended them to the care of his legitimate heirs.</p>

<p>The husband succeeded to his wife's dowry, failing
children or other near descendants. Of her extra-dotal
property he was entitled to one-third, and the wife could
not dispose of her dowry either by will or donation, so
as to exclude her husband or <span class="locked">children.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></span></p>

<h3>XIII.</h3>

<p>Besides the law of succession, there is another branch of
the Italian statutes in which the action of the political
idea upon civil law is equally apparent, namely, that
which treats of rights between neighbours, and of the
obligations <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">in solidum</span></i> attaching not only to the members of
families, but likewise to the members of sects and associations.
We have already observed that these are carried
so far as to make one member responsible for another's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
debts, and even for his delicts: this is a law to which
we shall have more than once to return and give our
attention. When real property is sold, we find that the
agnates and cognates have always a preferential right of
purchase. In the March of Ancona, the blood-relations
of a prisoner condemned to death may be compelled to
purchase his <span class="locked">estate.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a></span> At Bologna, relations are often
made legally responsible for one another, and, by the
rules of the corporations of merchants in that city, the
brothers of any bankrupt, who have lived in community
with him within a month before his failure, are held
responsible for his debts&mdash;even if they have separated
from him since that <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></span></p>

<p>According to the Florentine statute, the creditor of
any Commune or of any <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Universitas</span></i> (corporation) might
proceed against it, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sicut procedi potest contra alias
singulares personas debitrices, in persona</span></i>. This was
carried so far, that it was permissible to proceed against
every individual member of the association, and even to
have him arrested, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">liceat ipsi creditori capi et detinere
omnes et singulares personas dicti Communis vel Universitatis,
quousque fuerit integre satisfactum</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> If landed
property had been laid waste or houses burnt, the proprietor
was entitled to compensation from the author of
the deed; from his associates (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">consorti</span></i>), were he a noble,
or from his relations, even to the fourth degree, if a
commoner. Nay more, the injured person might also
proceed against the Commune, University, or district
(<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">plebatum</span></i>) in which the crime had been committed; he
was at liberty to follow any of these modes of redress,
and if unsuccessful in one to try <span class="locked">another.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a></span> The statute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
prescribed the form of procedure and the terms of the
<span class="locked">sentence.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a></span> The Commune, University, or district was
thus compelled to be always ready to raise the alarm,
when similar acts were perpetrated, and to pursue and
arrest the criminal, since, in case of failure, they were held
<span class="locked">responsible.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></span></p>

<p>In all matters, even such as purchases or sales, great
importance was assigned to the condition of the persons
concerned. In some cases, where land was to be sold,
the law required that it should be sold to a neighbour;
commoners, however, were not compelled to sell to
<span class="locked">magnates.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a></span> Similarly no one might buy, sell, or acquire
the usufruct of lands held in common, or any piece of
land or house touching another man's wall, without
according the joint-owner, associate, or neighbour the
right of <span class="locked">pre-emption.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></span></p>

<p>In case of a dispute between relations or associates, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">qui
consortes sint de eadem stirpe, per lineam masculinam usque
ad infinitum</span></i>,<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> the judge was bound, at the request of one
of the parties concerned, to leave the matter to the
decision of arbiters chosen by the parties themselves;
but no plebeian could act as arbiter between <span class="locked">nobles.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></span> In
reviving a law of much earlier date, the statute of 1355
informs us that arbiters were therein mentioned, as <span class="locked">blood-relations.<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></span>
Whence it may be inferred that similar compromises
began to be customary, at a very remote period,
between relations and associates who voluntarily selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
arbiters from their own group. Down to the year
1324, the custom had been sanctioned by law; at a later
time it lost its primitive character of a voluntary and
domestic agreement, and assumed the shape of a regular
legal trial.</p>

<h3>XIV.</h3>

<p>If we now compare the Florentine Statute Book with
those of other Italian cities, we shall find it marked by
various distinguishing characteristics, chiefly resulting
from the fact that in it democratic freedom was carried
to the farthest point obtainable during the Middle
Ages. Not only had every feudal privilege gradually
disappeared from it, but the great nobles had ended by
finding themselves in a position inferior to that of the
commonalty. Florence, as we have already seen, was
one of the first Italian cities to abolish serfdom in her
outlying territory by the law of <span class="locked">1289.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></span> And although
her rural population was always treated much worse than
the inhabitants of the city, it nevertheless enjoyed far
better conditions than prevailed in a great number of
communes. We have proof of this in the contract of
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Mezzeria</span></i>, which makes the cultivator of the soil an
actual partner with the proprietor, and which still remains
a great monument of civilisation and the cynosure of
modern economists who have never been able to devise
any better <span class="locked">system.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
The freedom and strength of associations, the extraordinary
ease with which any one might participate in the
government of the Commune, all contributed to the
triumph of democracy on the widest basis. Another
general characteristic to be noted, not only in the Florentine,
but in almost all the Italian statutes, is the constant
endeavour to shake off the intervention of the ecclesiastical
authority, which labours with incredible obstinacy to
maintain its privileges undiminished, and even seeks to
increase them; but which, nevertheless, finds them
gradually reduced almost to zero. The statute of
1415 ordains that "no person, university, or church,
no religious or clerical house shall presume to question
the jurisdiction of the Commune under pretence of
'benefice' or privilege, and that any one who opposes
this enactment shall be imprisoned until he renounce such
<span class="locked">privilege.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a></span> No excommunication nor interdict shall hinder
or diminish the action of the magistrates or the effect
of their <span class="locked">decrees.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a></span> Every man may freely exercise his
rights over all Church property derived from secular
<span class="locked">sources."<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span></p>

<h3>XV.</h3>

<p>Turning now to a general view of the Italian statutes,
we must remark that although the history of statutory
law presents many difficulties, owing to the infinite
number of different provisions to be found in it, the
diversity of these provisions is chiefly due to accidental
and temporary causes, extraneous to the natural and
spontaneous development of the law itself, which, examined
apart and with reference to its essential characteristics,
presents a striking uniformity. It may, however, be
noted that in the republics of Northern Italy the
Longobard law is far more predominant; while in those
of Central and Southern Italy Roman law obtains an early
and rapid ascendancy, and, subject to the changes which
have been indicated, ends by dominating at all points.
This progress becomes more apparent from year to year,
so that even in examining the statutes, the very same
conflict of antagonistic elements which we have already
noted, throughout the entire history of the communes and
of Italian civilisation, is brought before our eyes in civil
wars, in sanguinary struggles between Guelphs and Ghibellines,
in art, in literature, in all things. It is true that the
statutes only treat of juridical ideas and enactments; but
these seem to strive with the same ardour, and to aim at
the same ends, as the men whom they control.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the fourteenth century Italian
commerce began to make enormous advance, and this
gave a new impetus to Italian legislation. In fact, we
find a series of enactments enabling all mercantile affairs
to be transacted with much greater celerity, avoiding
legal quibbles, releasing merchant's credits from mortgage
or sequestration, and severely punishing all frauds and
fraudulent bankruptcies. In a word, we clearly discern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
the inchoation of the modern commercial code with which
these enactments are frequently in unison.</p>

<p>But in all these laws we always recognise the consequences
of commerce being divided and split into a
multitude of separate associations with statutes of their
own, judges of their own, and an exuberance of vitality.
At the same time, we recognise that the central authority,
though aware that its natural rights are threatened and
usurped on all sides, continues to exert its influence,
without method, indeed, or uniformity, but not without
vigour, and occasionally even with violence. At one
moment it seems to be vanquished; at another it comes
forth victorious. The entire history of the Commune
demonstrates a constant tendency to harmonise all these
distinct and often jarring elements&mdash;political, social, and
legislative&mdash;but this problem it never succeeds in solving,
and ends by relapsing into despotism. A true conception
of social unity was wanting; the idea of a due distribution
of authority was still unknown, either in real life or in
theory; accordingly whoever happened to have a share
in the executive authority, also assumed, as necessarily
connected with it, a share not only in judicial, but likewise
in administrative and legislative functions. Wherefore
it seemed that the only way to preserve liberty was
to parcel out the government among an infinity of hands,
and so to contrive that parties, associations, <i>cliques</i> (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">consorterie</span></i>),
families, and quarters of the town should each
and severally serve as checks upon all the others. In this
process of division and subdivision all the elements afterwards
constituting modern society were prepared, but the
State, in its true sense, was never discovered. Without
ballast to steady her, the ship of the Commune, driven
hither and thither in a ceaseless storm and buffeted by
winds from all quarters, could neither find anchorage nor
keep a settled course. No clear and certain conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
was ever reached of that law which, by limiting and
defining the amount of liberty guaranteed to each individual,
secures freedom to all.</p>

<p>The political life of communes, moreover, was always
confined within the walls of the dominant cities, since not
only the outlying territory was excluded from it, but
likewise all towns that had been annexed or conquered.
Every form of representative government was as yet
unknown. All who enjoyed political rights entered, each
in his turn, the Councils of the Republic, and sooner or
later nearly all rose to power. This made it necessary
that the States should have very circumscribed borders, as
otherwise it would have been impossible to govern them
at all. The French Revolution, by achieving for the first
time, in behalf of the nation at large, what the Italian
communes had effected for the cities, was able to proclaim
the civil and political equality of all who formed part of
the nation, and who were in consequence to be recognised
as citizens. From that time democracy became the predominant
characteristic of modern societies which, by
means of representative institutions, have found it possible
to secure freedom, even in large states, reconciling the
unity and vigorous action of the central government with
personal independence and with local liberty and activity.
But the Commune always wavered between the opposing
elements of which it was made up and which it never
succeeded in fusing into a true political organism.</p>

<p>The history of our republics may, in fact, be summed
up in an account of the varying predominance of one or
other of the great associations of which they were composed.
In Florence, we have, first of all, the conflict of
nobles and commons which is maintained with changing
fortunes. When the fraternities (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">consorterie</span></i>) of the
leading magnates obtained such ascendancy as to menace
popular liberties and destroy the social balance, notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
reforms were made in the statutes; the Commune was
completely transformed, and by means of the Ordinances
of Justice (of which we shall soon have to speak), the
nobles were overthrown and their associations broken
up. But as these associations were an integral part of
the State, their downfall was followed by a phase of rapid
corruption and decay. To the passions and interests of
caste succeeded personal ambitions, hatreds and passions
of a still more dangerous character. Families began
to be at strife; men who were at once powerful and
ambitious, came to the front; and Corso Donati, or
some other like him, would have soon become master
and tyrant of the Republic, save for the fact that a mighty
people, enriched by the speedy gains of an extended
commerce, devoted to freedom and opposed to the
nobility, had first to be disarmed. Thus to the supremacy
of the leagues of the magnates succeeded the predominance
of the Greater Guilds, between whom and the Lesser Guilds
a struggle was entered upon in the course of which the
latter obtained, in their turn, a share of power. At a later
period, the populace, represented by the plebeian Ciompi,
comes to the front, and threatens the utter dissolution of
the old social form of the Republic. Then new personal
ambitions, more fatal to freedom because more fortunate,
occupy the scene. The struggle between the Albizzi,
Pitti, and Medici terminates in the triumph of the last-named
family in the person of Cosimo the Elder, who
slew the Republic. Yet nothing of all this should cause
us much surprise. For if we bear in mind the beginnings
of the Commune and the elements out of which it was
constituted, we may readily see that all that happened was,
in the main, unavoidably bound to occur.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div><img src="images/i_t.jpg" class="drop-capi" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">THERE</span> are many reasons why the
history of Florence in the closing
years of the thirteenth century should
demand our fullest attention. It was
the period of the very important
political revolution resulting in the
establishment of those Enactments of Justice of which the
authorship is attributed to Giano della Bella, and which
Bonaini has entitled the Magna Charta of the Florentine
Republic. Even should this comparison seem strained,
it is certain that those enactments, sometimes strengthened,
sometimes modified, and occasionally suspended, remained
in vigour nevertheless for more than a century&mdash;a
fact of no small weight in so mutable a commonwealth
as that of Florence. Sooner or later many
neighbouring cities imitated these enactments, and in
1338 the Romans sent to request a copy of them, in
order to re-organise their city by the same means. On
this subject Villani wrote as follows: "It is known how
times and conditions change, for the Romans, who of old
built the city of Florence and gave it their own laws,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
now, in our days, have sent to ask laws from the <span class="locked">Florentines."<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></span>
It is likewise during this period that we behold
arts and letters suddenly blossoming to the greatest
splendour in the bosom of the Republic. Language,
poetry, painting, architecture, sculpture had already put
forth their first shoots in various Italian cities; but all
are now permanently rooted in Florence, and initiating a
new era in the history of the national intellect, suddenly
flash forth into a glory of light, irradiating all Europe as
well as Italy. Hence it behoves us to investigate most
minutely the nature of the favourable conditions, both
political and social, which rendered Florence the centre of
such marvellous activity and the focus of all those far-spreading
beams.</p>

<p>The remark might certainly occur, that although this
period has such undoubted claims upon our attention, its
history is already very familiar to us; it has been recounted
by contemporary writers such as Compagni and Villani,
who were not only eye-witnesses, but often active participants
in the events they described; it has been corroborated
by many original documents, and recently expounded
afresh by some most illustrious modern writers. Nevertheless,
the attentive student is compelled to recognise
that those times are less well known than might be
supposed; for even in perusing the works of the newest
historians we are perplexed by numerous difficulties and
doubts. In point of fact, what is it we learn from
Machiavelli, Ammirato, Sismondi, and Napier, and even
from Vannucci, Giudici, and Trollope, who wrote subsequently
to the publication of many newly discovered
original documents? That, after the battle of Campaldino
the arrogance of the nobles in Florence exceeded all
bounds; that they insulted, oppressed, and trampled on
the people; that there arose a daring and generous man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
named Giano della Bella, a noble devoted to the popular
party, who when holding the office of Prior proposed a
new law as a permanent remedy for these evils; that this
law was passed and sanctioned under the name of Enactments
of Justice, and that it excluded the nobles&mdash;or,
rather, the magnates&mdash;from every political post; that it
only permitted those really engaged in some trade or craft
to share in the government of the Republic; that it
punished every grave offence against the people, on the
part of the nobles, with exceptionally severe sentences and
penalties, such as chopping off hands, death at the block,
and, more frequently, by confiscation of property; that
slighter offences were only punished by fines; that the
magistrates were empowered to chastise any man of the
people (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolano</span></i>) showing hostility to the Republic or
breaking its laws, by proclaiming him a noble, and that this
sentence immediately excluded him from the government
and placed him under the same restrictions to which aristocrats
were subject. Furthermore, that if any magnate
convicted of offence should escape justice, one of his
relations or associates would have to expiate the crime
in his <span class="locked">stead.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></span></p>

<p>"A fact without parallel in the world's history!"
Giudici exclaims. For truly, although a fundamental
law of the Republic, this decree seems rather a freak
of revenge solely inspired by the blindest party spirit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
Accordingly almost every word of the decree excites
our suspicion. How can it be explained that Dante
was one of the Priors in office at the time, together
with others who undoubtedly were not artisans, or only
so in name, if it were true that the enactments excluded
all who were not <i>practically exercising</i> some trade?
And apart from a thousand lesser doubts, the fact
that innocent men were then condemned to death
merely because they were relations or fellow associates of
criminals who had escaped justice, is a point that we
cannot possibly understand. In a period of the densest
barbarism, it would be barely comprehensible; in Dante's
age, it is a mystery and a contradiction, confusing all our
ideas concerning those times. Therefore renewed investigation
of the subject cannot be altogether futile. It is
requisite to penetrate the true nature of the revolution
that had then been accomplished, and of the law that
resulted from it, and to bring both into harmony with
the times and with the history of Florence.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Towards the end of the thirteenth century the Republic
had acquired very high importance throughout Italy as
well as Tuscany. The fall of the Hohenstauffens, the
coming of the Angevins, the vacancy of the Imperial
throne had given an enormous ascendancy to the Guelph
party which in Florence was that of the democracy. Its
three great Ghibelline rivals, Pisa, Sienna, and Arezzo,
had been humiliated and conquered by the subtle diplomacy
of Florence and Florentine arms; and these victories
had not only re-established the Republic's political authority
in Tuscany, but opened and secured to it all the chief
highways of commerce. Through Pisa it had access to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
sea; through Sienna and Arezzo, to Rome, Umbria, and
Southern Italy; it could pass to the north through distant
Bologna, peopled with friendly Guelphs. Accordingly
the commerce of Florence was then rapidly increased,
and this republic of merchants, surrounded by other
republics equally devoted to trade and industry, stood at
the head of all Tuscany. On the other hand, however,
the augmented power of the Angevins was beginning to
excite the jealousy of the Popes who had first called them
to Italy, and who now turned their eyes towards Germany
in order to revive the Imperial pretensions, and thus check
the growing ambition of the French king. For Charles
of Anjou, whom they had named Senator of Rome and
Vicar-Imperial of Tuscany, now seemed determined to
follow the daring policy of the Swabian line by aspiring
to supremacy over Italy.</p>

<p>During this state of things, the Florentines managed to
keep their balance with marvellous <i>finesse</i>, and by leaning
this way, or that, frequently turned the scales on the
side they preferred. They utilised the king's soldiery to
crush Ghibelline cities and Ghibelline nobles; they leaned
on the Pope, to check Charles's arrogance; and they
showed readiness to favour the Empire, when the Pope
tried to assert temporal supremacy, as though, in the
present <i>interregnum</i>, he were the natural inheritor of the
imperial rights. By this means, the Republic not only
preserved its independence, but became a State commanding
the fear and respect of all <span class="locked">Italy.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a></span> This was all the
result of the shrewdness, energy, and intelligence of its
burghers, who governed with so much thriftiness and
wisdom as to achieve an unparalleled prosperity. "It
is a known thing," says Villani, "that down to this time
and for long past, such was the tranquillity of Florence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
that the City gates stood unlocked by <span class="locked">night,<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></span> no duties
were exacted in <span class="locked">Florence;<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a></span> and rather than impose burdens,
when money was needed, old walls and bits of land
within and without the City were sold to the owners of
conterminous portions of the <span class="locked">soil."<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></span> With few taxes and
no debts, the administration was excellently conducted;
it left the citizens unhampered, and increased the general
well-being.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, beneath this tranquil surface the seeds of
deep-rooted discord lurked in the bosom of the State, and
occasionally broke forth in sanguinary conflicts, of which
the discontent of the nobles was the principal cause. It
would be a serious mistake to believe that they were first
excluded from the government in virtue of the Enactments
of Justice. The measure had been prepared long
before, and although not then rigorously carried out, may
be said to have been already sanctioned in 1282, by the
decree placing the Priors of the Guild at the head of the
Republic. But it should not be thought on this account,
that the nobles had lost all actual power in the city at
the time. First of all, the new system of warfare, in
which municipal armies, composed of artisans, unprovided
with cavalry or men-at-arms, proved very incompetent,
had made the assistance of the nobles indispensable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
also began to render it necessary to employ foreigners:
soldiers of adventure from Germany, France, and Spain,
who earned their living by war alone. At Montaperti
(1260) the terrible defeat of the Republic's Guelph host
had been achieved by Manfred's Germans, and the Ghibelline
nobles banished from Florence. At Campaldino
(1289) it was Corso Donati, Vieri de' Cerchi, and other
Florentine nobles or potentates who had decided the fate
of the day. The nobles knew this, and constantly boasted
of it, in their contempt for the artisans and people. Being
trained to arms, and undisturbed by commercial cares,
they sorely chafed against being excluded from the government
by rougher folk far less fitted for war than themselves.
Accordingly, political animosities became more
and more heated; the nobles could neither be still nor
leave others in peace.</p>

<p>It should also be remarked that the nobles of the period
were no longer the feudal lords of former times, who,
isolated in their well-guarded strongholds, like so many
sovereigns, depended solely from the Empire and were foes
to the Republic. Having been ousted from the territory,
and obliged for some time back to reside in the city, they
now clung to the latter, but desired to hold rule over it.
Being surrounded on all sides by a powerful population
banded in trade guilds and masters of the Government;
being forcibly made subject to Republican laws refusing all
recognition of feudal rights, the nobles had been obliged,
in self-defence, to form Associations or Societies of the
Towers, which being ruled by custom rather than law,
were all the more firmly knit together. Originally, the
nobles had been chiefly united by family ties which were
still more closely respected on the disintegration of the
feudal order, when, in order to maintain their strength,
kinsmen banded together in separate castes or associations
and gave admittance to a widening circle of members.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
They clustered together in neighbouring palaces, often
lining one or more of the city streets; they lived in the
midst of their adherents, squires, domestics, and grooms,
and in moments of danger even summoned to their aid
the peasantry of their rural estates. Their possessions
were always handed down to their families or the Society
to which they belonged, and their disputes were settled
by chosen <span class="locked">arbiters.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></span> Besides all this, their deeds of vengeance
were decided upon in common, and the individuals
charged to execute them were always placed in safety
by their comrades, the whole association assuming the
responsibility of every deed of this kind. Often, between
one house and another, or in one of their palace yards,
there was an archway under which they administered
torture to any one they chose. In fact, speaking of the
Bostichi family, Compagni tells us that: "They committed
many evil deeds, and continued to do them for
long. In their own palaces, situated in the New Market,
in the centre of the city, they would string men up, and put
them to the torture at mid-day. And it was a common
saying in the land that there were too many tribunals;
and in counting the places where torture was applied,
people said: 'In the Bostichi house, by the <span class="locked">Market.'"<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a></span>
All this continued to be done, notwithstanding the very
severe laws already promulgated against the nobles. A
man of the people could be flogged, stabbed, or tortured,
without the author of the misdeed being brought within
the grasp of the law. Out in the country these same
nobles used all sorts of devices to perpetuate serfdom,
although for many years it had been legally abolished,
and by threats or open violence induced their peasants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
by means of fictitious contracts, to acknowledge obligations
from which they were lawfully <span class="locked">exempt.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></span></p>

<p>Thus citizens, already powerful in virtue of their social
position, contrived to retain much strength and great
political influence in the Republic, notwithstanding the
laws designed to keep them in check. Being excluded
from the Signory they could neither enter the Council
of One Hundred nor the Councils of the Captain,
in which the more important questions were discussed.
But they were admitted to those of the Podestà,
and this official, being of necessity a knight, often gave
judgment in favour of the nobles. Also, they were
continually employed as ambassadors, and given the first
posts in war; but they enjoyed most prominence in the
institution entitled the Guelph Society (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Parte Guelfa</span></i>), and
were specially appointed to all its chief offices. This
Society, founded, as we have previously shown, in 1267,
after the expulsion of Count Guido Novello, was charged
with the administration of all confiscated Ghibelline property
which had been formed into a <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">monte</span></i> or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">mobile</span></i>, or,
as would now be said, capitalised. This property was
to be employed for the subjection of the Ghibellines
and the support of the Guelphs, of whom Florence was
the Tuscan headquarters. It was on this account that
Cardinal Ottavio degli Ubandini had exclaimed: "Now
that the Guelphs have formed a fund in Florence, the
Ghibellines will never return there;" and his prophecy
was <span class="locked">fulfilled.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></span> In fact, the Ghibelline party was gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
swept away by the steady persecution to which it was subjected
on the complete overthrow of the Suabian line; and
Florence, having become exclusively Guelph, was divided
between the parties of burghers and populace, and that of
the nobles and magnates or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">grandi</span></i>. The latter, although
excluded from the government, or from <i>honours</i>, to use the
phraseology of the time, could never be ousted from the
Guelph Society, and continued to administer its large
revenues. This Society was ordered in the fashion of
a miniature republic, and notwithstanding numerous
attempts to introduce an increasing burgher element within
its pale, these efforts proved so fruitless and were so invariably
thwarted, that the statutes compiled in 1335, and now
extant in print, record the fact that money premiums were
offered to promote the nomination of new knights. To
each of the six knights elected during the year the sum
of fifty gold florins were awarded, "so that a city of such
great magnificence may be duly glorified by the number
of its knights." Thus while, on the one hand, every
means was taken to abase the great nobles, almost to the
extent of securing their extermination, on the other, this
threatened class continually gained reinforcement and
<span class="locked">support.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>With all these advantages, had the nobles been united,
they might have regained their position even after the
defeats of '66 and '82 and succeeded in dominating the
people. But they were divided, and hotly at strife even
among themselves. "There was much warfare" (Villani
says) "between the Adimari and Tosinghi, between the
Rossi and Tornaquinci, between the Bardi and Mozzi,
between the Gherardini and Manieri, between the Cavalcanti
and Buondelmonti, and likewise between certain of
the Buondelmonti and Giandonati; between the Visdomini
and Falconieri, between the Bostichi and Foraboschi,
between the Foraboschi and Malespini, and among the
Frescobaldi themselves, and between the members of the
Donati family, and also among those of many other
<span class="locked">houses."<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a></span> Nor is it surprising that such strong and
powerful cliques should have felt jealous of one
another. Added to this, the Guelph nobles included
the remains of the Ghibelline party, which cherished
Imperial tendencies; thus another germ of discord was
sown that encouraged and excited the people to prosecute
the war of extermination it had already set on foot.
The popular party was far better organised and united;
it was banded in various guilds forming part of the
general constitution of the State, and on every occasion
showed an energy and singleness of purpose never possessed
by nobles. It is true, that even at this juncture,
some seeds of jealousy were beginning to be discernible
between the greater and lesser guilds and the populace;
but open discord was long delayed. For the moment there
was no hint of it. Certain special conventions, drawn up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
in regular documentary form, had been arranged between
the members of one or more of the guilds, and these
agreements were designated at the time <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Legbe</span></i>, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Posture</span></i>, or
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Convegni</span></i>. But their object was chiefly commercial, being
designed to keep the price of certain commodities up to a
forced standard, and create illegal monopolies, and was
seldom the result of political interests or animosities.
They were not sanctioned by law, they certainly did not
promote concord, but their importance was slight.</p>

<p>Thus the city became increasingly divided and subdivided
into groups, and was apparently in danger of
falling to pieces. The lower classes were still undoubted
rulers of the government, but the nobles were
also powerful, if in a different way; hence unity and
concord were continually and seriously imperilled.
Necessarily, therefore, the chief aim to be pursued, in
order to avert a catastrophe, was the attainment of greater
equality among the citizens, of greater union and strength
in the various societies as well as in the government itself.
In fact, for a long time past, Florentine legislation and
successive revolutions had alike kept this object in view.
The law of August 6, 1289, abolishing serfdom in order
to emancipate the peasantry, was also another step towards
equality. Those of June 30, and July 3, 1290, prohibited
all agreements in any way opposed to the lawful constitution
of the guilds. The law of January 31, 1291, imposed
a fresh check on the nobles, by obliging all citizens, without
any exception, to submit to the jurisdiction of the
regular courts, and decreeing the severest penalties on any
one asserting, or trying to obtain, the privilege of trial by
special <span class="locked">tribunals.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></span></p>

<p>But a more notable point is the fact that every fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
decreed in such cases fell upon the fellow-associate or
relation of the criminal, should the latter contrive to
evade justice. However strange this rule may appear to
the modern mind, its explanation is to be found in the
account we have already given of the mode in which
property was held at the time, and of the constitution of
families and associations. When almost the whole of the
patrimony was shared by the family in common, it would
have been very difficult, and even dangerous, to inflict a
fine on any one member of the house while exempting the
rest, and for this reason the invariable tendency of the law
was to insist on their solidarity. This principle seemed still
more logical when it was a question of inflicting fines on
nobles banded in closely united associations, and who,
keeping all their interests in common, decided on acts of
vengeance, and proved their intention of holding all things
in common and dividing one another's responsibilities.
Where property belonged to the whole family, it was only
just that the whole family should be liable for the fine;
where an act of vengeance was done in common, and the
gravest offences committed in the name, and with the
sanction, of the whole kindred, there could be nothing
extraordinary in the law compelling one associate or kinsman
to be mulcted in lieu of another, beginning with his
nearest relations. Precisely for these reasons, it had long
been customary in drawing out the list of the nobles, for
the law to compel the said nobles to <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sodare</span></i>, that is, to
compel every one of them to stand surety not merely for
himself alone, but also for his relations, by depositing the
sum of two thousand <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>. In this way, since money-penalties
seldom exceeded the said amount, whenever a
noble was fined he could use the money he had already
deposited, or it could be employed for the same end by
the kinsman bound surety for him, in case he should have
escaped or contrived to evade the law by some unauthorised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
<span class="locked">device.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></span> These were exclusively and precisely the
principles upon which the Enactments of Justice were
also founded. Accordingly it is impossible to consider
them the personal invention of Giano della Bella, seeing
that they were merely a logical consequence and natural
result, inevitably evolved from preceding revolutions,
institutions, and laws. Indeed, for the most part they
only sum up and arrange older laws, so as to accentuate
more plainly their primary and enduring intent.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Giano della Bella was neither a legislator nor a politician,
but a man of action. A noble by birth, he had fought at
Campaldino, where his horse was killed under him; he
afterwards joined the popular side, by reason, it was
averred, of a quarrel at San Piero Scheraggio with Piero
Frescobaldi, who had dared to strike him in the face, and
threaten to cut off his <span class="locked">nose.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a></span> Whether this tale were true
or not, it is certain that Giano was a man of violent disposition,
great daring, small prudence, and disinterested
love of freedom; but he was by no means devoid of the
passion for revenge that even his admirers laid to his
charge. "A forcible and very spirited man" (says Compagni),
"he was so daring, that he defended matters forsaken
by others, said things others left unspoken, did his
utmost to bring justice to bear on the guilty, and was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
much feared by the Rectors that they dared not conceal
evil <span class="locked">deeds."<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a></span> According to Villani "he was a most
loyal and upright <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolano</span></i>, and more devoted to the public
good than any man in Florence, one that gave help to the
Commune without seeking his own profit. He was overbearing
and obstinate in wreaking revenge, and also achieved
some deeds of vengeance on his neighbours, the Abati, by
using the authority of the <span class="locked">Commune,"<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></span> for which the
worthy chronicler severely blames him.</p>

<p>When appointed Podestà of Pistoia, he immediately
plunged into party strife, persecuting one side and favouring
the other, with so much ardour that, instead of fulfilling
his duty of pacifying the different factions, he inflamed
their hatred to such a pitch that it was impossible for him
to remain there to the end of his official <span class="locked">term.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></span> The
whole course of his conduct in Florence proves, as we
shall see, that he must have been a man of scant prudence
and great impulsiveness. It was precisely these characteristics
which made him a leader of the people instead of a
legislator, and likewise an implacable enemy of the nobles.</p>

<p>After the battle of Campaldino the latter showed more
audacity and growing insolence. "It was we who won the
victory at Campaldino," they continually repeated, "and yet
you seek our ruin." Bent on forcing their way to the
front and gaining command, they daily insulted or injured
some man of the people. The law was powerless against
them, inasmuch as the offenders could never be unearthed;
the latter were carefully sheltered, and no one desired or
dared to testify against them. A <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolano</span></i> could be surrounded,
attacked, even stabbed, yet nobody had seen the
doer of the crime. Or some one would be dragged into
the houses of an association, maltreated, beaten or tortured
on the cord, yet all that occurred in those places remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
unrevealed. If some noble was condemned to a fine, he
made haste to declare that he possessed no separate estate,
and by his own negligence, or that of the magistrates, had
failed to give surety, while his relations repeated the same
<span class="locked">story.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></span> Hence it was necessary to recall the old laws into
vigour, make them still stricter, and decide on new and
sterner measures. So at last the priors in office from
the 15th of December, 1292, to the 15th of February,
1293, urged on by the public voice, under Giano's guidance,
commissioned three citizens, Donato Ristori, Ubertino
della Strozza, and Baldo Aguglioni, to frame a new
law fitted, not only to meet present dangers, but to assure
greater stability to the Republic in the future. On the
10th of January, the Bill being then drawn up, the Captain
of the People assembled the Council of One Hundred,
and proposed that the required Councils should be asked
to grant them full powers (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">balìa</span></i>)<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> to proclaim it, if it
were approved by the magistrates and by certain citizen
worthies. Some proposed, in amendment, that it should
be first read and discussed by the councils; but this
would have entailed a risk of the whole thing coming to
nothing. Accordingly the more practical course was
chosen, and by seventy-two votes, against two negatives
only, the requested <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">balìa</span></i> was granted. On the 18th of
January the new law, entitled "Ordinamenti," or "Ordini
di Giustizia," was proclaimed in the names of the
Podestà, captain, and priors, and with the concurrence of
the Heads of the Twenty-one Guilds and certain citizen
<span class="locked">worthies.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a></span> There is every reason to believe that Giano
della Bella was one of the worthies in question; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
although historians suppose him to have been the creator
and initiator of the law, since, as leader of public opinion,
he compelled the Signory to pass it, yet he was not in
the government at the time, nor does his name appear in
any official <span class="locked">decree.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a></span> Therefore he was by no means the
sole author or compiler of the new law.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>What, then, are these enactments? In replying to this
question it is requisite to leave the historians aside and
turn to the law itself. But there are several old compilations
of it, differing so much from each other, that one form only
comprises twenty-two rubrics, whereas some have more
than a hundred. Accordingly, the first thing to be done
is to ascertain which is the genuine and primary law passed
on the 18th of January, 1293, since on this alone can an
accurate judgment be based, and no other starting-point
is possible. There are six of these very different compilations&mdash;four
in print, and two still inedited. Two of the
number may be summarily dealt with as unnecessary to our
purpose. One is included in the general collection of
Florentine statistics, formed in 1415 by Bartolommeo
Volpi and Paolo de Castro, and printed with the false date
of Friburg, towards the close of the eighteenth century
(1778&ndash;1783). This consists of laws of entirely different
periods arranged haphazard, without regard to chronology,
and including the enactments, but these are given with
all the modifications and changes introduced at a later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
date, and are also confusedly jumbled. No historian
engaged on the times of Giano della Bella can make any
use of a collection of this kind, since it shows no proof
of authenticity. For the same reason we may also reject
the Miscellany preserved in the Florence Archives, and
that Bonaini calls "a <i>huge medley</i>," containing unconnected
laws of different periods, and different tendencies, some
enforcing and others modifying the Enactments of Justice.
Hence, while possibly of some importance with regard to
the history of the "Ordinamenti," this Miscellany cannot
help us to discover their primary form.</p>

<p>Four other compilations remain, one of which only is
inedited. Examination quickly shows that the one brought
out by Bonaini comprises no more than twenty-one rubrics,
and that the last of these, forming a general summary,
is mutilated; the other compilations contain a greater
number of rubrics, but, in all three, the general special
enactments of January, 1293, are invariably given under
the first twenty-eight <span class="locked">rubrics.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a></span> In fact, from the twenty-ninth
forward, appendices and posterior laws begin to occur,
often separately dated, and seemingly tacked on to the
enactments, in order sometimes to modify, sometimes to
strengthen them, or again to diminish their effect, or
because of their relation to cognate matters. All the
laws and statutes of the Republic suffered more or less the
same fate. Thus the notable divergences found in the
various compilations are reduced to very narrow limits as
regards the original body of enactments. Certain doubts still
assail us, however, seeing that we not only find twenty-two
rubrics on the one hand against twenty-eight on the
other, but because these rubrics clash on various points.
First of all, then, let us remark that the oldest compilation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
is undoubtedly the one published by Bonaini in 1855,
from the original MS. in the State Archives. The editor
felt assured of having discovered the original document of
the enactments, but conscientiously preferred to entitle it
the original <span class="locked">draft,<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></span> seeing that, as Hegel has since ascertained,
it is not the actual law that was approved
and proclaimed by the magistrates. The codex is of
great antiquity, and may be ascribed to Giano della
Bella's day. In fact, in one heading, first inscribed and
then cancelled, we find the date of 1292 <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">de mense ianuarii</span></i>
(1293, new style).<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> The usual formula heading all
decrees of the Republic is missing, and the said formula
not only gave the date and title, but occasionally added
the names of the magistrates promulgating the law. The
codex is of small size, full of erasures, alterations, and
additions written by different hands: often, too, there are
empty spaces left between one rubric and another to allow
room for future additions or corrections. Everything
plainly shows that this old codex is only a rough copy of
the law, standing exactly as it was drawn up, at the request
of the magistrates, by the three previously mentioned
citizens, and before it had been cast in its final form, or
legally sanctioned by those charged to discuss and approve
it, prior to its promulgation. Accordingly it is impossible
to decide with any certainty whether it was modified at
all, or in what degree. But although this rough draft is
somewhat anterior to the actual law itself, the existing
compilations are all posterior to it, and may consequently
include later appendices and modifications. Thus, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
examining the Latin compilation edited by Fineschi in
1790, and the Italian one brought out by Giudici
in 1853, both derived from old and authentic manuscripts,
we find each to have all the characteristics of a
regularly proclaimed law. Both begin with the official
formula, and are dated the 18th of January, 1292 (1293,
new style). On reading the rubrics appended to the
second (the Italian copy), which is much longer than
the other, we find various dates given, including that
of 1324; whereas the first (the Latin version) contains
none later than the 6th of July, 1295. Therefore the
latter is the older of the two, and the occasional divergences
existing even among its first twenty-eight rubrics
are undoubtedly caused by amendments introduced at a
subsequent time. Nevertheless, even the first rubrics of
the Latin compilation evidently contain modifications of
an earlier date than the 6th of July, 1295. For instance,
in rubric vi. we find the number of witnesses&mdash;a point left
undecided in the rough draft (rubric v.)&mdash;fixed at three in
the two posterior compilations, and this point (as we shall
see) can be proved on documentary evidence to have been
settled by law in July, 1295. Therefore we are justified
in concluding that it is the Latin and older compilation
that gives the enactments as they stood in July,
1295; while the Italian copy, although proved, by
examination of the codex, to be an official translation,
occasionally includes alterations of even a later date than
1295. If, however, we only keep in view their first
twenty-eight rubrics, and collate these with Bonaini's
draft, it will be seen that, saving for the non-appearance
in the latter of six rubrics, chiefly of a very insignificant
kind, all other divergences are rather formal than substantial.
In any case, wherever the three versions are
found to agree, we may be sure of possessing the law
passed on the 18th of January, 1293, in the precise shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
it wore at the time; but wherever, on the contrary, divergences
exist, we must seek the aid of the chroniclers and
of any new documents, should such be found, before
arriving at a definite conclusion.</p>

<p>Following these rules, we may therefore proceed to
examine the <span class="locked">law.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span></p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>What, then, were these Enactments of Justice, as originally
framed, and what is to be learnt from them? They
work a political and social change in the Republic, for
the evident purpose of promoting civil equality, giving
greater unity to the government and increased strength
to the guilds; also of assuring the harmony and concord
of the people, and curbing the arrogance of the nobles.
The more strictly political reform is confined to establishing
safe rules for the election of Priors, and creating a
new and more powerful magistrate, the Gonfalonier of
Justice, to sit in junction with the Priors.</p>

<p>By request of the Captain of the People, the Priors
authorised him to call a meeting of the Heads, or Consuls
of the Twelve Guilds, in order to deliberate as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
safest and most fitting mode of choosing their own successors.
All candidates to the priorate had to be enrolled in
some guild, and to exercise its trade, as the surest means
of proving that they were not of the aristocracy&mdash;always
the chief point to be ascertained. In fact no one remaining
a noble could be eligible to the Signory, even if
engaged in <span class="locked">trade.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></span> By means of subtle and often quibbling
interpretations of the law, it was possible to compromise
as to the actual practice of a craft, but never as to being
absolutely free from all taint of <span class="locked">aristocracy.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></span> Thus
Giano della Bella, in spite of merely having, as Villani
relates, some slight commercial interests in France, was
qualified, on discarding his rank and becoming one of
the people, to enter the Signory in February, 1293. In
July, 1295, as we shall see, the enactments were modified,
and it was sufficient for candidates to be enrolled in some
guild without practically exercising its trade, always providing
they did not belong to the nobility. Many regulations
were added to assure an equal division of public
posts among all the Sestieri of the city and all the guilds,
while prohibiting the nomination of several Priors belonging
to the same Sestiere, family, or guild. None leaving
office could be re-elected to it within two years, and this
prohibition was extended to his relations as well. The
office of Prior was held for two months; no one was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
allowed to ask or intrigue for it, but neither might one
refuse to accept it. The Priors had to dwell altogether
in one house, where they lived and ate in common, without
accepting invitations elsewhere or giving private <span class="locked">audiences.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></span></p>

<p>The next subject considered was the election of the
new magistrate, namely, the Gonfalonier of Justice. He
was chosen every two months from a different Sestiere
of the city, and his electors were the incoming Priors, captains,
and guild-masters, with the addition of two worthies
of each Sestiere. He was elected on precisely the same
terms as the Priors, saving that he might return to office
after one year instead of two; he lived with the Priors
as <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">primus inter pares</span></i>; he received the same honorarium
of ten <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">soldi</span></i> per day, expenses included, so that he was
practically unremunerated. But having higher attributes
in the eyes of the law, he became speedily and of necessity
the chief of the <span class="locked">Signory.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a></span> At the public parliament
the Gonfalon of the People was solemnly consigned to
him, and one hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">pavesi</span></i>, or shields, and twenty-five
cross-bows with bolts were placed at his disposal, for the
better equipment of part of the thousand <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i> yearly
selected to serve under him, the Podestà and Captain to
preserve order and enforce the execution of the new <span class="locked">laws.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
No relation of the Priors in office could be elected to the
Gonfaloniership. The creation of this new post certainly
serves to prove that the necessity of giving increased unity
and supremacy to the Government was already acknowledged.
But at that period Republican jealousy was too
strong to sanction anything more than a mere show of
supremacy. Accordingly, the Gonfalonier was only the
most influential of the Priors, and liable to be changed on
the same terms, albeit the fact of having the free disposal,
at given moments, of the citizen army undoubtedly
endued him with higher authority.</p>

<p>In treating of the branch of the enactments bearing on
social rather than political cases, we should remark first of
all that to these enactments was owed the settled constitution
of the Florentine guilds, which now hastened to reframe
or renew their own special statutes. The normal number
of the guilds was likewise established by the enactments,
and from that moment remained fixed at <span class="locked">twenty-one.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a></span> In
fact, the first rubric decreed that the guilds should take a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
solemn oath to maintain union and concord among the
people. The second rubric annulled and forbade, under
heavy penalties, all <i>companies</i>, <i>leagues</i>, <i>promises</i>, <i>conventions</i>,
<i>obligations</i>, and <i>sworn pacts</i>, that is, all agreements among
the people unprovided or unsanctioned by the laws, and
opposed or alien to the constitution of the guilds. Both
procurators and stipulators of similar agreements were
liable even to capital punishment; and any guild known
to be concerned in such agreement would be mulcted in
one thousand <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>; the consuls of the said guild, and the
notary who had drawn the deed, in five hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a>
All this plainly proves that the law was not devised, as
once believed and asserted, for the sole purpose of wreaking
vengeance on the nobles, but was also framed with
the intent of reforming the city and government by
solidly organising the guilds and granting them higher
political importance. Nevertheless, the humiliation of the
leading nobles was certainly one of the principal objects of
the law. Therefore we may now proceed to examine the
clauses directed to that end.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>First of all, to punish the nobles for their continual
attacks on the people it was requisite to make them
guarantee their collective responsibility, since, in defiance
of preceding laws, they frequently contrived to shirk that
obligation. Most offences being punishable by fines,
persons bound by no guarantees could easily evade the prescribed
penalty on some pretext or another: therefore the
enactments were framed to prevent such evasion of <span class="locked">justice.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
They likewise gave fresh force to old laws which had been
too often violated. "Further, to prevent the numerous
frauds daily committed by certain leading nobles of the city
and territory of Florence with regard to the guarantees
pledged, or rather, bound to be pledged by the said nobles
according to the terms of the statute of the Florentine
Commune, as decreed under the rubric: '<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">De la securtadi
che si debbono fare da' grandi de la città di Firenze</span>,' and
beginning with the words: '<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Acciò che la isfrenata spezialmente
de' grandi</span>,' &amp;c.&mdash;it is provided and ordained," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a></p>

<p>Consequently, all the nobles already enumerated in the
above-mentioned statute, and of whom a new list was then
made, were ordered to give guaranty, from the age of
fifteen years to seventy, without exception, by the payment
of two thousand <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>, a sum generally sufficient to
cover the highest fines exacted, apart from confiscation,
which penalty was not only commonly, but abusively
employed. The fact of being enrolled in a guild did not
suffice to exempt any of these nobles from the duty
of giving guarantees; the privilege of exemption being
solely granted to him whose entire family, for this or that
reason, even by special indulgence, had been spared the
duty of giving guarantees for five years at least, or declared
absolutely free (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">francata</span></i>). In either case the family was
considered to be thoroughly of the people, and entitled to
all the advantages deriving therefrom. The Signory was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
empowered to reduce the sum guaranteed (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">il sodamento</span></i>)
in the case of the poorer nobles, but it was precisely this
clause that opened the door to partiality and <span class="locked">fraud.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a></span> The
law proceeded to state that the fixed time for giving guarantees
was the month of January or February at the latest:
any one refusing or delaying obedience, no matter in what
way, would be banished, and his nearest kin in the male
line compelled to give surety in his stead. The penalty of
any crime committed by an unguaranteed person was to fall
on that person's relations. But when the penalty was death,
and the criminal had fled, his relations must pay three
thousand <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i> instead of the guaranteed two thousand. But
in case of mortal feud between the members of a family
their obligation of giving surety for one another was cancelled.
This plainly shows that when community of
interests and passions had ceased to exist the law no longer
insisted on the collective responsibility of kinsmen or
associates. This assists our better comprehension of the
real scope of the <span class="locked">enactment.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a></span></p>

<p>When, however, the members of associations acted
in common, as one entity, the law framed for the
purpose of dissolving those associations made the members
reciprocally responsible, obliging them to guarantee
and pay for one another. But no penalties save fines,
and these only within certain limits, were exacted from
relations and fellow associates, since an association was
only fined as a collective body. This will explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
what Compagni and Villani meant by saying that according
to the enactments, "one associate was bound for the
<span class="locked">other."<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></span> We may see how Machiavelli blundered, or at
least exaggerated, in his interpretation of their words
when he stated in general terms that "the associates of a
criminal were made to suffer the same penalty to which
the latter was <span class="locked">condemned;"<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></span> and we can also note the
mistake committed by modern writers in clinging to an
interpretation, that is totally contradicted by the terms of
the enactments, which would be otherwise in opposition
to the culture of the period and the most fundamental
principles of law. The measures specially directed against
the nobles may be reduced to two leading clauses, namely
the revival in a more rigorous shape of the old laws excluding
the nobles from office and obliging them to guarantee
and pay one another's fines; and the increased severity of
the punishments inflicted on them by&mdash;to use Villani's
words&mdash;"a different mode of doubling ordinary <span class="locked">penalties."<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a></span>
Let us now see what these penalties were in their
aggravated form.</p>

<p>According to the enactments, should a noble murder
or procure the murder of one of the people, both the
noble and the doer of the deed are to be condemned to
death by the Podestà, and their property destroyed and
made <span class="locked">confiscate.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></span> Should they escape by flight, they are to
be sentenced in contumacy, and their property confiscated.
Nevertheless their guarantor will have to pay the sum for
which he stood surety, but with right of reimbursement
from the confiscated and demolished property of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
fugitive criminal. All other nobles who, without being
direct accomplices in the crime, have had any share in it,
are sentenced to a fine of two thousand <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>; if failing
to pay this, their property is confiscated, and their kinsmen
or guarantors bound to pay it in their stead. But
when the crime in question was that of inflicting serious
bodily hurt, the doer of the deed and its instigators
were sentenced to a fine of two thousand <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>. If refusing
to pay the penalty, their hands were chopped off;
if escaping the reach of justice, their possessions were
sacked, their funds confiscated, and their guarantors
bound to pay the fine, but with the usual right of reimbursement
from the sums confiscated by the State.
For slighter offences, slighter penalties were adjudged.
In every case the guilty were forbidden to hold any
public office until five years had elapsed. For murderous
attempts, the sworn testimony of the injured person or
his nearest relation, together with that of two witnesses
to the public voice on the matter (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">testimoni di pubblica
fama</span></i>), was considered sufficient proof of the crime; nor
was it necessary for the two witnesses to have seen the
crime actually committed. This was the clause most
obnoxious to the nobles. In general they were little
disturbed by threatened punishment, even of the severest
kind, since they always hoped to escape it. But they
were roused to fury as well as alarm, when measures
were taken for the rigorous enforcement of the penalties
prescribed. And this was precisely the chief intent and
soul of the enactments. The whole course of procedure
enjoined by them was almost as summary as that of
martial law, and allowed much weight to public
opinion, which, in the midst of party strife, was no
trustworthy guide. The close union prevailing in
associations had made ordinary legal procedure very
difficult, if not impossible. Hence it was ordained that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
whenever a crime was perpetrated, the Podestà was
bound to discover its author within five, or at most
eight days, according to the gravity of the deed, under
pain, in case of neglect of loss of office and a fine of five
hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i> for minor offences. In such case, however,
the Captain was charged to take the matter in hand, and
subject to the same penalties. All shops were then to
be closed, the artisans called to arms, and the Gonfalonier
to be on the alert to punish all recusants. But when the
Podestà discovered the criminal, and it was a case of
homicide, he and the Gonfalonier together were to ring
the tocsin without waiting for the sentence of the court,
and assembling the thousand select men, proceed to
demolish the houses belonging to the criminal. The
guild-masters were prompt to obey the Captain's
summons. When slighter offences were in question
the criminal's houses were not destroyed until sentence
had been <span class="locked">passed.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a></span> It should be remarked that this
pulling down of houses was never carried to the point of
total demolition, and, particularly in cases of petty
crimes, the Gonfalonier and Podestà always settled beforehand
what damage should be <span class="locked">wrought.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></span></p>

<p>Very severe penalties were imposed both on injured
persons failing to denounce <span class="locked">crime,<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></span> and on the makers of
false <span class="locked">accusations.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></span> When one of the people received
hurt through joining in some quarrel of the nobles, or in
cases of conflict between master and man, the enactments
were not applied, and the common law was again <span class="locked">enforced.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
Other clauses followed touching unjust appropriation of
the people's property on the part of the nobles, and
obstacles interposed by them to bar the former from
due receipt of income, for which offences, fines varying
between one thousand and five hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i> were prescribed
in the customary <span class="locked">way.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></span> A noble sentenced to
any fine was forbidden to beg or collect the amount from
others, since this would have made it easier to commit
deeds of vengeance in common and pay the penalty by
means of a general subscription. Therefore any noble
begging contributions from others was condemned to a
special fine of five hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>; while all trying to
collect money for him, as well as those supplying it,
were mulcted in one hundred <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
No appeal of any sort was permitted against sentences
pronounced according to the <span class="locked">enactments,<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a></span> since these
overruled all ordinary statutes, and it was forbidden either
to prorogue, suspend, or alter them, under penalty of
incurring the severe punishment prescribed in the <i>General
Conclusion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>Thus the Enactments of Justice were framed. As
already stated, their object was to fortify the guilds, give
greater unity to the Government and the people, humble
the nobles, and promote the dispersal of associations.
Only it was to be doubted whether a law of this kind
could be fully carried out, or would not rather be violated
by the nobles, thus sharing the fate of many earlier laws
promulgated for the same purpose. Giano della Bella
used his best efforts to avert this danger. He had not
compiled the enactments, nor was he in office when they
were discussed and passed; but he undoubtedly assisted
in promoting them. On the 15th of February, 1293,
shortly after they were proclaimed, he was elected to the
"Priors," and on the 10th of April&mdash;namely, ten days
before his term of office expired&mdash;we find that a new law,
devised for the purpose of "fortifying" the enactments
among which it was subsequently incorporated, was presented,
discussed, and passed by all the State Councils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
This additional law, one decidedly accordant with the
spirit of action rather than of debate, possessed by Giano
della Bella, was of a very simple kind. It ordained that
another thousand men, together with one hundred and
fifty <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">magistri de lapide et lignamine</span></i> and fifty <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">piconarii
fortes et robusti, cum bonis picconibus</span></i>,<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> should be added to
the force of one thousand <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i> at the disposition of
the Gonfalonier of Justice, of the Captain and Podestà.
The object of this new measure was self-evident: it was
intended to inflict real punishment; to thoroughly confiscate
the property and demolish the abodes of all nobles
doing injury to the people. Accordingly the aristocrats
were provoked to fury, and their hatred of Giano could
no longer be restrained. But he was nowise alarmed;
on the contrary, it spurred him to new efforts, and he
planned another measure, that, if carried into effect, would
have proved a deathblow to the nobles.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the latter's position as magistrates of
the Guelph Society still kept their power intact; so, in
order to humble them, Giano proposed to deprive their
captains "of the Seal of the Society, and of its property,
which was considerable, and hand these over to the
Commune. Although a Guelph, and of Guelph nationality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
he hoped, by this measure, to humble the power of
the <span class="locked">magnates."<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a></span> In fact, once deprived of the seal, that
was the symbol, as it were, of their separate entity; once
their movable property, or funds, transferred to the
Commune, their caste would have been notably enfeebled,
if not destroyed, and the last stronghold of nobility lost.
Giano's proposal was likewise justified by a law established
by the Guelph Society, decreeing the latter to be only
entitled to one-third of the property confiscated from the
Ghibellines, while as matter of fact it had appropriated the
whole. Hence there was some reason for compelling the
Society to disgorge at least the two-thirds it had unduly
usurped. To what extent Giano's plan was fulfilled, the
absence of documents leaves us in ignorance. Although
the incident is recorded by <span class="locked">historians,<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></span> the Guelph Society
long continued to exercise tyrannous rule. At any rate
the mere fact of proposing this law suffices to explain the
increasing hatred developed against Giano, and the speedily
visible signs of approaching disaster in the city.</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>Thereupon the people rose to the emergency, and
in order to be prepared for events, hastened to avert
all risk of foreign war by concluding peace with the
Pisans, in spite of the latter being already reduced to
such extremities, that the continuation of the war would
have certainly led to their still deeper humiliation and
abasement. But the Florentines decided for peace in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
order to "fortify the position of the people, and lower
the power of nobles and potentates, who often acquire
renewed strength and vitality by <span class="locked">war."<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a></span></p>

<p>Negotiations were set on foot during the Gonfaloniership
of Migliore Guadagni (April 15 to June 15, 1293),
and concluded soon afterwards during that of Dino Compagni.
The terms arranged were: the restitution of
prisoners; free passage through Pisa for the merchandise
of all communes included in the Tuscan League, and the
same right of passage, free of duty, for Pisan merchandise
through the States of the League. For the term of four
years the Pisans were to contrive the election of their
Podestà and Captain, in such wise that one of the pair
should always belong to one of the communes of the
League, the other to some house not rebelled against the
same, and no member of the family of the Counts of
Montefeltro was ever to be chosen. Now the Pisan leader
who had defended the city so valiantly, and filled the
offices of Podestà, Captain of the people and of war, was
precisely Count Guido Montefeltro. Hence, by the
terms of the treaty, he was now forced to leave Pisa,
together with all the foreign Ghibellines; and twenty-five
leading citizens were also to be given in hostage. Thus
the Pisans were compelled to behave with the harshest ingratitude.
The count, indeed, might have made them pay
dearly for it, being still in command of a numerous and
most devoted army; but he preferred to bear the insult
with dignity. Appearing before the Council, he recounted
his services to Pisa, the ill return made for them, and
then, having received the monies due to him, instantly
went away. The Pisans were likewise pledged to dismantle
the walls of the fortress of Pontedera, and to fill
up the trenches; farther, to recall to the city all the leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
Guelph exiles. On the other hand, Florence was to
give back their castle of Monte-Cuccoli, and all their
other possessions in Val <span class="locked">d'Era.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a></span></p>

<p>Having thus put an end to what seemed for the
moment their wealthiest concern, the Florentines devoted
more energy to the less important undertakings
on hand. Various districts or castles, such as Poggibonsi,
Certaldo, Gambassi, and Cutignano were reduced to submission.
The Counts Guidi were deprived of jurisdiction
over numerous domains in the upper valley of the
Arno. Also possession was resumed of many others in
the Mugello, which had been illegally usurped by the
said Counts Guidi, the Ubaldini, and other powerful
lords. A commission of three burghers of the lower
class was then appointed to estimate all possessions appertaining
to the city and its territory. These commissioners
likewise cleared the lands of the St. Eustachio
Hospital, near Florence, of many unlawful occupants, and
put the estate under the direct protection of the Consuls
of the Calimala <span class="locked">Guild.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></span> Another fact should also be
noted, if only to prove what universal energy was displayed
at this juncture by the Florentine people who, as
Villani phrases it, "were heated with presumption and
consciousness of power." A certain man fled to Prato
after committing some crime, and was given refuge
there. The Republic immediately demanded his extradition,
and on Prato's refusal, sentenced the Commune
to a fine of ten thousand <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i> and the surrender of the
criminal, despatching a single messenger with a letter
to this effect. As the authorities of Prato were still
recalcitrant, war was promptly declared, horse and foot
called to arms, and the town was finally compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
to yield the point. "And this is how the hot-blooded
Florentines managed their <span class="locked">affairs."<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></span></p>

<h3>XI.</h3>

<p>Just when all was safe and tranquil outside the walls,
the worst of dangers began in the city. The nobles were
determined to prevent the Enactments of Justice from
taking effect, and accordingly contrived that after all
attacks upon the people, the offenders should be cited
before judges belonging to their own party. These
conducted the trial to their advantage, and thus the
Podestà, without being aware of it, punished the innocent
instead of the guilty. For the nobles sheltered evildoers,
protected their fellow associates, and on every attempt to
enforce the law, did their best to raise riots. All these
proceedings were fiercely combated by the people, under
the guidance of Giano della Bella, who was always reiterating
the cry, "Perish the city rather than justice!" Accordingly
public feeling became so inflamed that the most
sanguinary measures were threatened in retaliation on the
nobles. The first family to incur the worst penalties
decreed by the enactments were the Galli. One of that
line having mortally wounded a Florentine merchant in
France, their dwellings in Florence were <span class="locked">demolished.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
This instance easily prepared the way for sterner measures.
The people clamoured for new and more vigorous sentences;
therefore it was feared, says Compagni, "that
were the accused left unpunished, the rector would be
left to bear the brunt, and thus no accused person was
granted impunity." The fury of the nobles reached
its climax, and they complained, with some show of
reason, that "if a horse at full gallop chanced to whisk
its tail in the face of a <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolano</span></i>, or some one in a crowd
pushed against another man's breast, or small children
came to blows, there was no reason why their property
should be ruined on such slender <span class="locked">pretext."<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly they conceived the idea of conspiring to
the bodily hurt of Giano, the ringleader and head of the
people, and thus getting rid of him for ever. To
compass his assassination seemed easy, by reason of his
straightforward impetuosity and incautiousness. He
had great influence over the populace, but even this
was a point open to attack. As we have seen, the Lesser
Guilds and the populace lived by petty industry and small
trades carried on within the city; and their chief profits
being derived from noble customers, the latter had much
ascendancy over them and no few adherents in their
ranks. Besides this, a certain amount of jealousy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
already sprung up between the lowest class and the
well-to-do burghers, who, being mainly concerned in the
export and import <span class="locked">trade,<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a></span> were independent of the nobles,
hated them, and sought their destruction. Nevertheless
these burghers could not approve of Giano's attempts to
rouse the ambition and increase the strength of the lowest
class, which was disgusted at being excluded from the
Government and yearning to have a share in it.</p>

<p>Another element of strife was soon to be introduced by
the election of Pope Boniface VIII. (December, 1294).
This Pontiff had an immoderate appetite for temporal
power, and believed that owing to the interregnum of
the Empire, its rights could now be assumed by the
Papacy throughout Italy and Europe. He was particularly
anxious to increase his power in Florence, the
leading city of Tuscany, where his own predecessors
had appointed Charles of Anjou to the post of imperial
vicar. Therefore he quickly began to open negotiations
with the nobles, whose present weakness increased their
readiness to come to terms with him, and who would
have willingly resumed the government of the city in
his name, just as their Ghibelline ancestors had often
held it in the name of the emperor. But this was
naturally opposed by the burghers, who being determined,
on the contrary, to maintain the liberty and independence
of the Republic, could not, albeit staunch Guelphs, side
with the Pope at that moment.</p>

<p>Secret intrigues between Boniface and the nobles were
now carried on through the Spini, rich Florentine merchants,
who, as bankers to the Curia, had agents in Rome.
The first step hazarded was to call to Tuscany a certain
Giovanni di <span class="locked">Celona,<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a></span> who was already on the march
towards Italy with several hundred men, in response to
a summons from the Pope and the nobles. The latter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
intending to use his force for their own ends, had made
him many promises, and with the concurrence, it would
seem, of certain of the burghers. But the affair dragged,
and men's passions were now outstripping the political
manœuvres employed to feed the flame. Accordingly,
without further delay, it was decided to hatch a scheme
for the murder of Giano della Bella. "The shepherd
struck down, his flock will be scattered," so said the
nobles.</p>

<p>Only, as it fell out, the party in favour of craft prevailed
over the side preferring violence. At this moment
frequent excesses, perpetrated by the people, remained
unpunished through the pusillanimity of the judges.
The butchers in particular, led by one Pecora, an
audacious ruffian, who had publicly threatened the
Signory, committed worse outrages from day to day.
Hence, at the popular meetings frequently held by Giano,
the nobles, knowing his love of justice, would whet his
indignation by saying, "Dost not see the violence of
the butchers? Dost not see the insolence of the judges,
who, by threatening to punish the rectors when the time
of investigation <span class="locked">arrives,<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a></span> wrest unjust favours from them?
Suits are suspended for three or four years, and sentences
never pronounced." Thereupon the loyal Giano would
promptly reply, "May the city perish, rather than this
state of things be continued! Let laws be framed to
repress all this wickedness." And then the nobles would
maliciously hasten to inform judges and butchers that
Giano meant to crush them with new <span class="locked">laws.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a></span> In pursuance
of this cunning scheme, they suggested a law against
exiles, in the hope of soon being able to apply it to Giano
himself. It seems that he was on the point of falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
into the trap, but received timely warning. So then,
refusing to hear another word, either from friends or foes,
he forbade that any law whatever should be proposed,
and threatened his enemies with death. Accordingly the
meeting only served to increase the general heat and
<span class="locked">ferment.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></span></p>

<p>The nobles were not to be checked so easily. Seeing
that Giano still retained many friends, and that there was
no hope of conquering by craft, they held a private
sitting in the church of San Jacopo Oltrarno, to discuss
what should be done; and violent measures were once
more suggested. Giano's personal enemy, Betto Frescobaldi,
the same who had once struck him in the face at
San Piero Scheraggio, spoke to this effect: "Let us cast
off this slavery; let us arm and rush to the Piazza; let
us kill both friends and enemies of the popular class, as
many as we find of them, so that neither ourselves nor
our sons may ever be crushed by them." But the
promoters of intrigue were again in opposition, and Baldo
della Tosa replied very quietly, "The wise knight's
counsel is good, but too risky, since, should the scheme
fail, we should all perish. First let us conquer (our
enemies) by cunning, and excommunicate them with soft
words.... And when thus excommunicated, let us harry
them in such sort that they can never lift their heads
<span class="locked">again."<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a></span></p>

<p>But quite suddenly a fitting opportunity for violence
spontaneously arose. Corso Donati, one of the most
powerful and arrogant of Florentines, induced some of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
followers to assault Messer Simone Galastroni, and a riot
ensued in which one man was killed and two wounded.
Both sides laid complaints; but when the affair was
brought before the judges charged to try the case, one
of them, influenced by the usual party spirit, arranged
that the notary should reverse the depositions of the
witnesses. When the case, thus garbled, was brought
before the Podestà, Giano di Lucino, he acquitted Donati,
and condemned Galastroni. Thereupon the people who
had witnessed the riot, and knew all the circumstances,
rose to arms, shouting through the streets: "Perish the
Podestà; he shall perish by fire!" They made for the
palace, faggots in hand, to burn down the door, and
expecting to be actively assisted by Giano della Bella.
But, on the contrary, he sided with the magistrates,
whose authority he invariably held in respect. Nevertheless,
the door of the Podestà's palace was consumed, his
horses and chattels were stolen, his men captured, and
his papers scattered and torn. And as many persons
knew him to possess indictments against them, they took
care to destroy his official documents. He and his wife
contrived to escape to an adjoining house, and obtained
refuge there. Corso Donati, who was in the palace at
the time, saved his life by flying from roof to roof.</p>

<p>The Councils assembled the next day, and for the
honour of the Republic decided to restore all the
Podestà's stolen property to pay him his salary and send
him away. Thus order was re-established at once, but
public feeling was still very inflamed, and the nobles saw
that the moment for wreaking vengeance on Giano had
finally arrived. In fact, some of the people were his foes,
owing to the numerous calumnies purposely launched
against him, and among others the charge of having
promoted decrees to the hurt of the judges and butchers;
some, again, were furious because he had sided with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
Podestà, while others denounced him as the author of the
riot. Accordingly, profiting by the general confusion
and uncertainty, his enemies succeeded in obtaining the
premature election of a Signory opposed to his views;
and he was speedily cited before the new magistrates on
the charge of having caused the disturbance. At this
the whole city rose in tumult. Some desired his condemnation;
but the populace hastened to assume his
defence. Thereupon he decided to go away, and left
Florence on the 5th of March, 1295, for he shrank from
being the cause of civil strife, hoped that his departure
would open the eyes of the wiser citizens, and that the
latter would speedily procure his recall. However, in
this his calculations were at fault, for he had many more
enemies than he imagined. Accordingly he was sentenced
in contumacy in the name of the enactments he had
urged, and of which he was held to be the author. The
Pope hastened to congratulate the Florentines, and Giano
realised that his star had set. So, acting with his usual
impetuosity, he unhesitatingly removed to France, where
he possessed some share in the Pazzi bank, and died
there in exile. His Florentine houses were demolished,
his friends and relations condemned to punishment, but
the Enactments of Justice long remained in <span class="locked">force.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a></span> With
regard to Giano, Villani remarks that "every one who
became a leader of the people or the masses in Florence
was invariably deserted." He adds that "on account of
this novelty, there was great perturbation and change in
the people and city of Florence, and that henceforth the
artisans and populace had little power over the Commune;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
and that the government remained in the grasp of rich and
powerful <span class="locked">burghers."<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a></span></p>

<h3>XII.</h3>

<p>These concluding words from the chronicle of a skilled
observer such as Villani enable us to understand more completely
the general character of the revolution described;
for as this was the natural outcome of many preceding
disturbances, its study throws a new light on earlier events.</p>

<p>When the Florentines succeeded in destroying the
castles of feudal and Ghibelline nobles scattered over their
territory, and in forcing the conquered to inhabit the
city, the Republic became split, as we have seen, in two
parties, constantly at strife: the one composed of Ghibelline
lords, the other of Guelph <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i>. When the
Hohenstauffens of Naples and Palermo called all the
Ghibellines of Italy to arms, the magnates of the party
took the lead in Tuscany, with Frederic and Manfred to
back them, again dominated Florence and drove out the
Guelphs. But when the Swabians fell and were replaced
by the House of Anjou, the Empire became weakened,
and Italian policy took a new turn. The Guelphs once
more triumphed in Florence, and the democratic element,
already constituting the real strength of the State, wreaked
vengeance on the Ghibellines, who seemed to be almost
annihilated. Only as it chanced, at this moment, the
Guelphs were split into two factions, the nobles on one
side, the people on the other; and this division led to
another and equally bitter struggle, undertaken for the
purpose of crushing the magnates outright. Thus the
latter were driven to crave admission to the guilds, to
assume democratic habits, and even to discard their old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
family names, unless resigned to exclusion from the
government. After a prolonged series of different legal
measures and revolutions, the Enactments of Justice finally
achieved the aim that the Florentine Republic had so long&mdash;and,
indeed, from its birth&mdash;kept in view, namely, the
triumph of democracy.</p>

<div id="ip_476" class="figcenter" style="width: 366px;">
<img src="images/i_537.jpg" width="366" height="554" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption"><p>RIOT IN CORN MARKET, FLORENCE.</p>

<p>(<i>From an old MS. in the Laurentian Library.</i>)</p></div>

<p class="right smaller">[<i>To face page 476.</i><br />
</p></div>

<p>But the Republic comprised the populace as well as the
people; and although both orders were united in fighting
the nobles, they split apart as soon as their common victory
was assured. Thus the party of the rich burghers,
or Greater Guilds, gradually sprang into being. At first
there were twelve of these guilds, and they seemed to be
at one with the nine Lesser Trades, afterwards increased to
fourteen; but, as time went on, these fell more widely
apart from the remaining seven, and strictly Greater,
Guilds, and began to struggle against them, thus constituting
the party of the rich burghers or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolo grasso</span></i>.
The formation and successful career of this party, so long
at the head of the Government, dates, as Villani tells
us, from the defeat of Giano della Bella, whose downfall
was caused by the temporary alliance of the nobles
and the more powerful section of the people. The
latter soon divided both from the nobles and lower class,
was equally victorious over either party, and constituted
one of the most energetic, sharp-witted, and intelligent
democracies of which history has record. It comprised
the richest and most vigorous section of the people, known
for that reason as the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolo grasso</span></i>, and gradually became
master of the city. And albeit this state of things was a
natural result of past revolutions, it was undoubtedly precipitated
by the Enactments of Justice. These had been
promoted by Giano, with the aid of the people, to be
used as a weapon against the nobles. He fell a victim to
the latter, when they hoodwinked the people by feigning
to unite with them for the nonce. It was certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>
altogether against his own will that Giano helped to promote
the formation of a party, that, issuing from the
wreck of the nobles and populace, finally excluded both
alike from all participation in the government of Florence.</p>

<p>For a long time, at any rate, this party raised the power
of the Republic to a very lofty height, and directed its
policy for more than a century. The moment of its consolidation
coincided with that in which Florence became
the seat of Italian culture, and hence of the general
culture of Europe. Nor is there any cause to be surprised
by the vast intellectual, political, and moral success
of the commercial democracy of Florence. In the days of
the Hohenstauffen, the Italian aristocracy undoubtedly
constituted the most cultivated and civilised part of the
nation; all great political questions, and the great
struggles between the Papacy and the Empire, in which
the whole of Europe took so lively a share, were alike
carried on by that class. The Court of Frederic II. had
been the headquarters of those contests, and the most
dazzling centre of mental light in the world at the time.
The language spoken there was the language of courtiers;
the Court was sceptical, and the first poets were princes
or barons. The Emperor Frederic, his son Enzo, and
his secretary, Pier della Vigna, gave voice to the first
notes of the Italian muse. It was a privileged and limited
order, in which literature and science still retained the
characteristics of chivalry and scholasticism. In imitation
of their French and Provençal masters, these poets lauded
some imaginary woman or some fantastic and unreal love in
obstinately artificial verse. They were never able to cast
off mediæval and conventional forms. At the same time,
however, the merchants and working men of our republics,
more especially of Florence, were scouring the world,
founding banks and business firms throughout the East
and the West; they were studying jurisprudence, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
and everywhere demonstrating a special aptitude for
framing laws, creating new institutions, and directing vast
concerns. By this means they acquired that practical
knowledge of mankind and the universe, that sense of truth
and reality, so entirely absent from pre-existent literatures,
and precisely required to originate the first literature of
the modern world.</p>

<p>Naturally, however, those merchants, solely versed in
commerce and petty local politics, lacked the breadth and
loftiness of thought, the mental culture and refinement
needed to solve the hard problem without help. At the
same moment, Florence, the most active and intelligent
of Italian republics, was enduring the series of great
and radical changes, already described, which after much
sanguinary strife and a new rearrangement of social conditions,
suddenly raised her to a truly fortunate position.
Owing to her successes in war, Florence now commanded
every highway of commerce, and, by the amazingly rapid
extension of her trade, was enabled to acquire mighty and
no longer contested preponderance in Tuscany and become
its chief as well as its central city. The actual antagonism
between the Pope and the Angevins, together with the
altered conditions of the Empire, enabled her to steer
cautiously between those rival powers and assume for the
first time great and genuine political importance in Italy.
Thus the extent of her concerns and the circle of her ideas
were simultaneously enlarged. The two most intelligent
and most hostile classes of her citizens, namely, the now
powerful traders and the nobles now reduced to equality
with them, became transformed and definitely fused in one
class during the course of their fierce conflict, excluding, on
the one hand, the lowest order of the people, and on the
other, those of the nobles who, whether aspiring to absolute
rule or obstinately clinging to feudal customs and the
authority of the Empire, remained blindly opposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
municipal institutions which were nevertheless predestined
to triumph. Need we then feel surprised if at this moment
art and literature put forth their fairest blossoms, and in the
life-giving air of freedom were seen to expand their leaves
and shed their fragrance through the world? It is enough
to read the records and glance at the laws of the Republic
in order to discern that in the closing years of the fourteenth
century a new spirit was stirring the people and a new sun,
as it were, rising in the sky.</p>

<p>Every page of the chronicles records the undertaking of
very important public works, the erection of city squares,
canals, bridges, and walls. And simultaneously with these,
the most enduring monuments of modern art were springing
up from the ground. During the same period Arnolfo
di Cambio worked on the Baptistery, began the church of
Santa Croce, and, according to the chroniclers, received
from the Signory a solemnly worded order to reconstruct
the old cathedral from the foundations by erecting a new
one "of the most magnificent design the mind of man
could conceive, rendering it worthy of a heart expanded to
much greatness by the union of many spirits in <span class="locked">one."<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></span>
Undoubtedly it was then that Arnolfo laid the first stone
of the fane considered by many the finest church in the
world. At the same time a great number of monumental
buildings and public works were being also carried on:
Santo Spirito, for instance, Orsammichele, and Santa Maria
Novella. In 1299 Arnolfo likewise began the Palace of
the Signoria, another marvel of modern architecture, that
seems to be so thoroughly in character with the Republic
and expressive of the youthful vigour then animating the
Florentine people. In the same year the construction of new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
walls, suspended since 1285, was also resumed. And while
churches, public buildings, and private palaces were rising
on all sides, Giotto's brush was employed to cover their
walls with a lavish profusion of lofty and immortal compositions;
sculpture rivalled painting in decorating temples
with imperishable works, and gave birth to the Tuscan
school that was afterwards to culminate in Donatello,
Ghiberti, the Della Robbia, and Michelangelo. What,
too, are the names most frequently occurring in the records
of those times, and amid the struggles promoting or
following the Enactments of Justice? At every turn,
among the Priors, the Gonfaloniers, and ambassadors, or at
hot debates in council, we meet with Dante Alighieri, Brunetto
Latini, Giovanni Villani, Dino Compagni, and Guido
Cavalcanti, the creators of Italian poetry and prose. The
Divine Comedy bristles with continual allusions to the
events, amid which it was conceived, and which all seem to
be informed by the same spirit, since, even in a thousand
varying garbs, it always asserts its identity. Therefore
the Enactments of Justice are neither the work of a single
individual, nor suddenly improvised by Giano della Bella,
but rather the outcome of many revolutions: a body of
statutes proving and explaining the definite form and
character of the Florentine Republic. The same character,
albeit less splendidly displayed, appertained in varying
degree to the other Italian communes. But of them all
Florence was ever the most original and brilliant example.</p>

<h3>NOTE TO CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>At this point it is necessary to allude to a question that has recently
arisen concerning the Enactments of Justice. Signor Salvioli and
Prof. Pertile, when describing certain Bolognese statutes of 1271
for keeping the nobles in check, took it for granted that the Florentine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
enactments of 1293 had been copied from those. But the
Bolognese statutes of 1271 having never been unearthed, the hypothesis
met with little favour. When Prof. Gaudenzi edited the
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ordinamenta sacrata et sacratissima</span>" of Bologna in 1282&ndash;84
(Bologna, the Merlani Press, 1888), he noted their marked resemblance
to the Enactments of Justice of 1293, and considered it to
be beyond a doubt that the latter had been derived from the former.
Indeed, he went to the point of asserting as a fact "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Che in genere
i rivolgimenti e gli ordini di Firenze non furono che l'imitazione di
quelli di Bologna</span>" (Preface, p. v.).</p>

<p>The decided injustice of this last assertion has been already pointed
out by Dr. Hartwig, in his recent precious work on Florentine history
("<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ein Menschenalter Florentinische Geschichte, 1250&ndash;1293</span>" (Freiburg,
1889&ndash;91), extracted from vols. i., ii., and v. of the "Deutsche
Zeitschrift für Geschichtwissenschaft"). For in truth Florentine laws
and institutions issue very directly from the history of Florentine
society and Florentine revolutions, which are very different from those
of Bologna.</p>

<p>As to the other question, that is, whether the Florentine enactments,
of 1293 were really derived from the Bologna statutes of 1282,
I feel considerable doubt, and believe that no definite solution can
be reached until fresh researches in the Florence Archives have corroborated
the result of Prof. Gaudenzi's studies of Bolognese documents.
Meanwhile I need merely remark&mdash;That the people's
struggles with the magnates, and the harsh and often cruel laws promulgated
against them, were not exclusively confined to Florence, but
incidents of very common occurrence in the history of our communes.
Notwithstanding many points of general resemblance, these conflicts
and laws varied very much in different communes. Hence, in order
to prove to what extent the Bolognese enactments served as models
for those of Florence, it is not enough to compare the two codes and
note their respective dates. As plainly proved by the events we have
related, and additionally confirmed by all the later researches of
Hartwig, Del Lungo, and Perrens, the Florentine ordinances are found
to be a synthesis of other and much earlier laws against the nobles,
and sometimes literal reproductions of them. The enactments themselves
quote a law of 1286 frequently mentioned by historians, and, as
we have seen, even the "Consulte" of 1282 refer to an earlier law against
the nobles. These anterior laws are the veritable source of the
Florentine enactments, which, however, are not solely designed, like
the Bolognese ordinances, for the repression of the nobles, but to
promote the transfer of the government to the Greater Guilds, a change
already inaugurated in Florence as far back as 1250. It is this double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
purpose that constitutes their specific character. It behoves us to
unearth more of these laws in the Florence Archives and collate
them with those of Bologna before deciding that the Enactments of
Justice, so peculiarly connected with the whole course of Florentine
history, were mere copies of the Bolognese ordinances. Professor
Gaudenzi's publications do honour to his historical research. But I
venture to repeat that, in my opinion, the question cannot be really
settled without fresh investigation of the Florentine rolls. This task
is now being carried on by Signor Salvemini, and I hope that he may
make some new and profitable discovery. The problem is interesting
enough to claim solution.</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">AFTER</span> the enforcement of the Enactments
of Justice (1293) and the expulsion
of Giano della Bella, the
Florentine Republic passed through a
phase of extraordinary and almost delirious
confusion. Its incidents are very
familiar to us, owing to the splendid
series of chroniclers and historians who, from that
moment, began to record the minutest particulars of all
that occurred under their eyes. Modern writers have
also studied that period and ransacked its archives;
more especially Professor Del Lungo, who has recently
given proofs of an industry and learning which cannot be
sufficiently praised. Nevertheless, I believe that some
useful work may be done by trying to bring all those
facts together and scrutinising their organic unity, in
order to ascertain whence they proceeded, whither they
tended, and thus explain, if possible, the primary cause
of so much disorder and the real significance of the new
revolutions undertaken. I may also add that such investigation
might prove to have much historical importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
since it concerns the time in which not only a
new art, new literature, and new civilisation first sprang
into being, but when the old mediæval social order
was decaying and fading away, and the society of the
Renaissance beginning to take shape.</p>

<p>In the midst of these events the figure of Dante
Alighieri stands forth in giant mould, instantaneously
arousing the most earnest attention, and enhancing the
value of all his surroundings.</p>

<p>As we have frequently observed and repeated, the
history of Florence runs a very plain course down to
the year 1293, through the series of wars and revolutions,
during which the Guelph inhabitants of the city first
attacked the Ghibelline feudal lords, who, castled on
every surrounding hill, impeded all trade; and then,
having conquered them, demolished their strongholds,
and forced them to dwell inside the city walls, subject to
the laws of the Commune. Next, the people were compelled
to combat and break down the surviving feudal
element that sought to assert itself in the city. Before
the year 1293 this too had been destroyed, and only the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Grandi</span></i> were left, namely, nobles stripped of their titles
and of the old feudal privileges of their class. The
Enactments of Justice, which dissolved their associations
and excluded them from all share in the government, had
increased, on the other hand, the strength of the guilds
and the people. These accordingly were the masters of
Florence, and the new law supplied them with a most
efficacious means of continuing the persecution and
routing the nobles in the tribunals of the State. The
terms Guelph and Ghibelline were still retained, but had
lost their original meaning. The old aristocracy, constituting
the real nucleus of the Ghibelline party, having
now disappeared, the city was wholly Guelph. The
general condition of Italy also fostered this state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
things. In fact, owing to the fall of the Hohenstauffens
and the success of the Angevins, summoned to Italy by
the Pope, the Guelph party had triumphed throughout
the Peninsula. The murder of Conradin (1298) had
proved the death knell of the Ghibellines.</p>

<p>The triumph of France was more and more assured,
and during the interregnum of the Empire Philip the
Beautiful played almost the part of an emperor. At the
same time Boniface VIII. loudly declared that the Pope
stood above all kings and princes of the earth, and that
all were bound to yield him submission.</p>

<p>But division still reigned in Florence. First of all,
germs of future discord were lurking in the bosom of the
people itself, owing to its subdivision into rich people
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolo grasso</span></i>), or the Greater Guilds, and small people
(<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolo minuto</span></i>), or Lesser Guilds, having the populace at
their back. The Greater Guilds, at the head of the
principal manufacturing business and the vast export and
import trade, were always ready to undertake fresh wars,
which, by burdening the city with taxes, greatly diminished
the internal luxury upon which the Lesser Guilds, engaged
in small crafts, depended for their daily support. It
needed little to convert this clash of material interests into
a political conflict, especially when we remember that the
Greater Guilds had taken possession of the government
without allowing the Smaller Crafts any share in it. For
the moment, however, the lower class, although so
turbulent and numerically strong, lacked cohesion and
experience, and had no leading men at its head. But
although without real elements of political strength, and
still incapable of forming a party, it was excellently suited
to swell the ranks of already constituted parties having the
wit to use its aid in their progress to power.</p>

<p>The nobles, on the other hand, although defeated, persecuted,
and oppressed, were by no means stamped out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
still retained some measure of influence and skill. The
expulsion of Giano della Bella was an instance in point;
for, by contriving to make the people believe him its
foe, they induced it to desert him and then provoked
the mob to attack him. Although deprived of legal
authority, the nobles were still practically strong. Always
boasting of their victory of Campaldino, they had undoubtedly
played a prominent part in all the greater wars
of the Republic in past times, and even now made far better
soldiers than the popular class. As the wealthy proprietors
of town and country mansions, castles, and farms,
they were undistracted by commercial cares, and had
more leisure for military pursuits; while the material
independence they enjoyed made them all the more
sensitive to the sting of political ambition. It was natural
that they should seek and obtain the co-operation of the
populace in their contest with the burghers. Thus, in
junction with the former, they constituted a vast and
dangerous body of agitators, but without organic cohesion,
and all equally ineligible to office, inasmuch as the nobles
had been excluded from power in 1293, and the populace
had never been allowed any share of it.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>At this time the world began to perceive what results
the subtle craft of the Florentines was capable of achieving.
The art of secretly becoming masters of the State,
that, at a later period, gave Cosimo and Lorenzo dei
Medici such triumphant supremacy in the Republic,
enabling them to hold sovereign rule while remaining
private citizens in the eyes of the law, this art was
now discovered by the nobles. It consisted in leaving
republican institutions untouched, and showing no desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
to be concerned in them, yet contriving that none save
personal adherents should be admitted to power. The
offices of the Guelph Society afforded an efficacious means
to this end, for, as we know, the nobles were eligible to
those offices, and when holding them could declare any
citizen a Ghibelline, confiscate his property, and exclude
him from the government at their own pleasure. Thus,
without being members of the Signory, they had found
a more or less legal method of preventing their worst
enemies from entering it. Giano della Bella was fully
awake to this danger, and had tried to avert it; but the
nobles had frustrated his purpose by compassing his expulsion
from the city.</p>

<p>As another useful means of regaining their forfeited
power, the nobles managed to obtain the right of choosing
the magistrates, in order to exercise a personal influence
over them. Many of the magistrates were foreigners who
came provided with foreign notaries, chancellors, and subordinate
judges, while certain others, as, for instance, the
Podestà and the Captain of the People, were necessarily
bound to be knights&mdash;that is to say, nobles. They gave
judgment in political as well as civil and criminal cases.
In fact, it was the function of the Podestà and Captain, in
junction with the Gonfalonier, to enforce the enactments;
and besides this, political and common law were so intermixed
at the time, that it was impossible to separate the
one from the other. Originally, as we have already seen,
the Podestà was the virtual head of the Commune. He
commanded the army, signed treaties of peace; and even as
ancient historians recorded Roman events in the name of
the Consuls in office, so the Florentine chroniclers registered
the events of their city under the name of its
Podestà and even occasionally of its Consuls. But towards
the close of the thirteenth century things were changed.
With the destroyal of feudalism, the development of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
civil equality and increased recognition of Roman law,
the political importance of those offices was lessened.
The Podestà and Captains of the People were gradually
lowered to the status of ordinary high judges. Hence
both they and their subordinates steadily declined in
authority and strength; and being worse paid and less
feared, became more open to bribery, and more easily subjected
to the influence of the nobles. Many of these
officers came from Romagna, and the Marches, and the
greater number from Gubbio. Reared under tyrannical
governments and trained to Roman law in the school of
Bologna, they had no previous knowledge of the real
significance of party conflicts in Florence, and seldom
succeeded in acquiring it; hence they also failed to discern
the true meaning of laws such as the Enactments of
Justice, which were mainly political laws. All this contributed
to render them easily and blindly subservient to
those desiring to use them as tools. In fact, the whole
literature of the period teems with fierce invectives against
"the wicked, accursed, and perverted judges bringing ruin
upon <span class="locked">cities."<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
Thus by favour of the lower class and the mob, by the
unjust verdicts of the Captains of the Guelph Society and
the corruption of alien judges, the nobles endeavoured to
regain their lost ground and again seize possession of the
government. Nor was it an altogether impossible plan,
seeing that at this moment (as will be presently shown)
they received powerful foreign aid. But unity was
indispensably required, and no unity was to be secured
among a party composed of not only different, but heterogeneous
elements. Accordingly it was already easy to
foresee that, sooner or later, the fiercest discord must
inevitably break out in their midst.</p>

<p>Dino Compagni remarks in his Chronicle, that "the
powerful citizens were not all nobles by birth, but were
sometimes styled <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Grandi</span></i> for other <span class="locked">reasons."<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a></span> The <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Grandi</span></i>,
in fact, were composed of ancient aristocratic families,
despoiled of feudal privileges and titles; of old-established
burghers raised to a higher position on the score of their
wealth and of those proclaimed <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Grandi</span></i> by the people for the
sole purpose of subjecting them to the penalty of exclusion
from power. Naturally the old aristocracy were full
of distrust and contempt for new-comers, who often continued
(if not personally, by means of their kinsmen) to
carry on trades and manufactures, and thus maintain their
relations with the rich burghers opposed to the lower
classes, whereas the latter were more in sympathy with
the really influential and aristocratic section of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Grandi</span></i>.
Nor was this all. The latter party likewise comprised
country nobles, such as the Ubertini, the Pazzi of Valdarno,
and more particularly the Ubaldini owning nearly
the whole of the Mugello and dominating it with their
fortified castles. The fortress of Montaccenico, one of their
main strongholds, guarded by a triple circuit of walls, had
been founded by the Cardinal Ottavio degli Ubaldini, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
has a place in Dante's "Inferno," and who once said, "If
I ever had a soul, I have lost it, for the sake of the
Ghibelline cause." All these territorial lords clung to their
feudal traditions with far greater tenacity than the rest,
and being very hostile to the people, were equally opposed
to the Republic, which was always at strife with them.
When residing in the city they were undoubtedly compelled,
like the others, to obey the common laws; but
in their own castles they and their kindred still asserted
the rights of feudal barons.</p>

<p>In order to sap the strength of the Pazzi and Ubertini,
the Florentines, in 1296, established the two colonies of
San Giovanni and Castelfranco between Figline and Montevarchi
in the Upper Valdarno. All adherents of the
nobles willing to settle on these domains were freed from
vassalage and exempted from taxation for ten <span class="locked">years.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a></span>
But measures of this kind would have been useless against
the Ubaldini, and prolonged and sanguinary hostilities
had to be engaged with them. By logical rule these territorial
lords should have been Ghibellines and imperialists;
but the Empire was now distant and feeble, France and the
Pope were menacing close at hand. Accordingly they
rather tended to combine with the Guelph nobles of
Florence, and more particularly with those of ancient
descent, thus forming a new element in that curious
agglomeration of diverse forces. Also, seeing that private
jealousies and hates are always readier to burst into flame
when unrestrained by the organic unity and common
interest of a well-organised party, it will be easy to
understand what confusion and disorder prevailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the powerful support of one kind or
another furnished to the nobles from abroad, and in spite
of their really menacing attitude, there remained one
inexorable truth that must be always kept in view, since
it affords the best explanation of the phase of Florentine
history. It consisted in the fact that the aristocratic faction,
doomed to decay and dissolution, was confronted by the
young and vigorous party united in the Greater Guilds,
bound by common interests, and constituting the real
motive power and future of the Commune. The history
of those times is nothing more, in short, than the history
of the process by which the Greater Guilds succeeded in
becoming the very core of the Republic, in spite of the
numerous obstacles in their path, and likewise succeeded
in eliminating all hostile or alien elements. For some
time past these guilds, and especially the first five, on
which all the others were more or less <span class="locked">dependent,<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a></span> had
been prospering to an extraordinary degree. And when
their position was farther strengthened by the Enactments
of Justice, their statutes, with the amendments then
introduced, very clearly showed that in augmenting their
own wealth they purposed not only to enrich the Republic,
but also to heighten its power. Before long the five
leading guilds jointly constituted an <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Universitas Mercatorum</span></i>
that rose to the authority of a regular commercial
tribunal in 1308, and issued a definite set of statutes in
1312. Indeed all this may be considered the main part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
of the reforms promoted by Giano della <span class="locked">Bella,<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a></span> and the
point on which, favoured by the conditions of the period, he
was most successful. We have the best proof of this in the
fact that incessant party strife notwithstanding, the prosperity
of Florence increased, at that time, to a positively
prodigious extent. Villani repeatedly alludes to this state
of prosperity and general well-being, adding that continual
festivities were then held in Florence, and that the Republic
could call to arms as many as 30,000 men in the city,
and 70,000 in the <span class="locked">territory.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a></span> What was of still greater
moment, its bankers manipulated the chief trade of the
world, and flooded all markets with Florentine goods.
They conducted the affairs of the Roman Curia; they
managed nearly the whole commerce of France and
Southern Italy; all the sovereigns of Europe came to
these bankers for aid, and frequently employed keen-witted,
enterprising Florentines in their mints, their treasuries,
and their embassies. Thus money flowed into the city
from all sides; and it was at this moment, so it is said,
that Boniface VIII., giving audience to the ambassadors of
various powers, and finding to his surprise that all of
them were Florentines, cried out, "You Florentines must
be the fifth element!" As a natural result of this state
of things the petty Republic became a first-class power,
wielding everywhere, and over Italy in particular, a preponderating
influence. All neighbouring cities, great and
small, tried to copy the laws and institutions they deemed
the source of its amazing prosperity. Even Rome herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
seemed desirous to organise her magistracies, councils, and
Commune on the Florentine <span class="locked">pattern.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a></span></p>

<p>It was this that most irritated the Popes in their
perpetual struggle with the Roman municipality, and now
specially irritated Boniface VIII., who seemed determined
to crush the Commune. But he was strenuously opposed
by the nobility and people, who gave him no truce, and
drove him to wander, almost a fugitive, from town to
town. Of haughty temper and boundless ambition, his
conception of the papal authority rose to the height of
craving universal rule. Hence he could not be resigned
to the stubbornness of the Romans, and still less to the
example and encouragement afforded them by Florence.
He therefore conceived the plan of subduing the latter
city and reducing it almost to the condition of a fief of the
Church, under a governor of his own choice. Having
once formed this scheme, he began to prosecute it with
his customary ardour. There was certainly a good chance
of success, save for one insurmountable obstacle that
he omitted to take into account. The chance in his
favour was the fact that Florence, being now a republic
of traders, had small means of offering armed resistance.
The army of 100,000 men, so proudly enumerated by
Villani, consisted of a species of national guard of artisans
and peasants having the barest smattering of military
training, with no officers and no generals fitted to take
command. It comprised no mounted troops, since
nobles alone could find time for the requisite cavalry
training. The Commune naturally feared to place any
trust in the nobles of the town, while those of the
territory were avowedly hostile. The Companies of
Adventure, afterwards open to hire, had not yet begun
to be established. Nevertheless, an army was needed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
and, moreover, one commanded by competent leaders, if
the Republic wished to preserve its authority in Italy, and
protect its trade from the growing jealousy of its neighbours.
This was the reason formerly inducing its rash
acceptance of Vicars nominated by the Popes, and that
had also induced it to confer supremacy for ten years on
Charles of Anjou, who had accordingly supplied the State
with captains and soldiery. Why should not Boniface be
able to clench a similar bargain on even more effective
and permanent terms? The Republic's need of a military
leader was as urgent, nay, more urgent than before;
while the consent and support of the nobles might be
considered assured. But the insurmountable obstacle,
unforeseen by the Pope, was that the Florentines had
always wanted and still wanted defenders, but refused
to have rulers; nor would it be easy to induce them to
yield this point, either by craft or persuasion. The
subject on which they were most tenacious, and would
never give way, was the popular government of the
guilds, and this government would have to be destroyed
or reduced to submission before the Pope's scheme could
be carried into effect.</p>

<p>The task certainly had its difficulties. In fact, the
problem could only be solved by force, and Boniface was
not the man to shrink from employing it; hence collision
was unavoidable. As an additional complication, the
Republic, about to bear the brunt of the Pope's fury, was
thoroughly and determinately Guelph, not only Guelph
from sentiment or by force of old traditions, but even
more from motives of interest. In fact, it had risen to
existence by centuries of struggle with powerful Ghibellines
and aristocrats, and had finally built up the government
of the guilds on the ruins of those adversaries'
strength, and greatly assisted therein by the success of
the Angevins summoned to Italy by the Popes. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
chief trade of the Republic, and main source of its vitality
and power, was that carried on with France, with Southern
Italy&mdash;now held by the Angevins&mdash;and with Rome.
Hence it could not entertain the idea of rousing the
enmity of the French king, Pope, and Angevins, who
were all allied at the time. Besides, the Ghibelline party
in Tuscany was then represented by all the cities hostile
to Florence. Sienna, Arezzo, and Pistoia inclined more
or less openly to the Ghibelline side. The Pisan Republic,
which had so zealously assisted Conradin's cause, still
flaunted the Ghibelline flag. This State was in perpetual
rivalry with Florence, and sought to bar her from access
to the sea, the command of which was now more pressingly
needed than before. The strife between these republics
could only end in the annihilation of the one or the other.
Therefore the Florentines were compelled to keep on
good terms with the Pope, yet at the same time forced
into opposition against him. In this condition of affairs
all will understand why Florentine history should be so
complicated and obscure.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>After the expulsion of Giano della Bella, the nobles
seemed again masters of the city for a time; and their
spirits were immoderately raised by their success in procuring
the election of a Signory (June 15, 1295) exclusively
composed of their own friends. By the beginning of
July they had concerted their plans, and repaired to the
Piazza armed for the fray. But the people were already
gathered there and in superior force, so that civil war
would have instantly broken out had not certain friars
and citizens intervened, and fortunately contrived to
pacify the public excitement. Nevertheless, the Signory
being favourable to the nobles, determined to turn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
opportunity to account, and on July 6, 1295, managed to
get the Bill passed that, as we have previously related,
was incorporated in the enactments for the purpose
of modifying them and considerably attenuating their
<span class="locked">severity.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a></span></p>

<p>Some of these modifications were of a purely formal
kind, but others encroached on the substance of the law.
As the enactments now stood, accomplices in the offences
decreed punishable were no longer classed with the direct
authors of crimes, a single <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Capitanus homicidii</span></i> now being
recognised. Nor was the testimony of two witnesses of
good repute any longer considered sufficient proof of the
crime, the testimony of three witnesses now being
required. Finally it was no longer indispensable that
candidates to the Signory should be practically engaged
in some trade, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">continue artem exercentes</span></i>; their enrolment
in the guild of the trade being decreed sufficient proof of
their eligibility, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">qui scripti sint in libro seu matricola
alicuius artis</span></i>. This last concession was, in fact, slighter
than it appeared, seeing that even before then the <i>practical</i>
exercise of trade had been more often apparent than real.
But the principle for which men had fought was now
cast aside, and putting together the various concessions
granted in 1295, we plainly see that the amendment of
the law was a genuine victory for the nobles. In fact, the
popular discontent ran high at the passing of this Bill, and
Villani tells us that the Signory who had proposed and
carried it were treated with much contumely and scorn on
leaving office, and even greeted with volleys of stones
in the public <span class="locked">streets.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a></span> Accordingly a popular reaction
ensued that proved to be the germ of new and serious
discord among the citizens. The first step taken was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
deprive the nobles of certain of their weapons; the next
to proclaim some of the less factious aristocrats members
of the popular class, in order to weaken their <span class="locked">party.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></span>
Besides this, fresh laws were soon decreed to restore the
pristine force of the enactments, followed by other
measures of the same kind, culminating in the creation of
a new magistrate for the express purpose, as will be seen,
of ensuring the strict fulfilment of the law. But it was
impossible for these changes to be effected without fresh
discord and bloodshed in the city.</p>

<p>For there was not only fiercer strife just then between
the nobles and the people, but the former now split into
two divisions, formed respectively of those bent on doing
away with the enactments, and those who had renounced
that idea. These new factions were designated by the
names of the two families acting as leaders, namely, the
Donati and the Cerchi. The latter were of humble origin,
but had made their way up and were now counted among
the richest merchants in the world. They boasted a wide-spreading
kindred, numerous friends, owned vast estates
both in town and country, and lived in grand style.
They had recently purchased many palaces of the Counts
Guidi, members of the oldest Florentine nobility; and
by lending their houses at St. Procolo to the Signory, to
whom no palace had yet been assigned, were more easily
enabled to keep in favour with the heads of the State.
Villani, being of the opposite party, says that the Cerchi
were "easy-going, innocent, and savage." They were,
in fact, business folk, unpractised in warfare, and with
small aptitude for political intrigue. The term "savage"
was applied to them on account of their humble descent,
and Dante himself, though an adherent of their party,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
speaks of it as "savage" (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">selvaggia</span></i>). In virtue of their
origin and continued practice of trade, they were liked
and esteemed by the people, and their avowed opposition
to the <span class="locked">Donati<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a></span> won them still higher favour. Besides
the advantages of wealth and of wide-spreading family
ties, their courtesy of manner helped to advance their
popularity.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the "gentle-born and warlike"
Donati, as Villani calls them, were of old feudal descent.
Messer Corso, the head of the family, was a daring,
shrewd, hard-hitting man, of moderate means, but so
immoderately haughty and ambitious as to tolerate no
equals, and least of all among the enriched merchants.
He was known as the baron, and Compagni, who was on
the Cerchi side, says that whenever Corso rode through the
streets, "he seemed the lord of the earth" ("<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">che la terra
fosse sua</span></i>"). Many magnates of the city, many nobles of
the territory, and particularly the Pazzi of the Upper
Valdarno, considered him their leader. Some of the
merchants also adhered to him, and among others the
Spini, who owned a bank in Rome, and as business agents
for the Pope and the Curia, drove a very profitable trade.
This Donati faction was detested by the burghers, but in
favour with the populace, who greeted the baron with
shouts of applause as he passed through the streets. But
although Corso's courage and subtlety stood him in good
stead during the struggle now impending, his arrogance
alienated many followers and disposed them to join the
Cerchi. The Cavalcanti were among his opponents, and
that graceful poet and valorous knight, young Guido<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
Cavalcanti, had conceived so special and deadly a hatred
for him that the two never met in the streets without drawing
their swords. The Donati's influence in the city was
chiefly owed to the favour of the captains of the party,
while that of the Cerchi was maintained by the support of
the Signory. Thus the palace of the Guelph Society and
of the Priors became the headquarters, as it were, of the
two opposing camps. The two families likewise owned
neighbouring estates in the country and dwelt near each
other in town. Their respective houses were situated in
the St. Piero quarter or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sesto</span></i> of the city, which, on account
of the continual disturbances occurring there at the time,
was known by the name of "The Scandalous Sesto" (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Sesto
dello Scandalo</span></i>). Everything served as fuel to the flame.
Words uttered by either party were reported and exaggerated
to the other. How Corso Donati always spoke
of Guido Cavalcanti as Guido Cavicchia; how, when
alluding to the head of the family and party chief, Vieri
de' Cerchi, he would ask, "Has the ass of Porta brayed
to-day?" On the other hand, the Donati were styled
by their adversaries "The Ill-famed," as being men of
bad repute and doers of evil.</p>

<p>It is not easy to exactly ascertain how and when these
parties first became known as <i>Bianchi</i> and <i>Neri</i>, for the
chroniclers are rather vague and not altogether agreed
upon the point. Both names were of old usage in
Florence as distinctive family appellations; in fact, there
had already been White Cerchi and Black Cerchi, but the
latter afterwards became the chiefs of the White <span class="locked">party.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a></span>
The same names had then been employed to designate
two opposite factions of the Cancellieri house waging
fierce strife in Pistoia. The Florentines, who exercised
great authority in that town, mediated between the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
sides to bring them to make peace; and to achieve this
intent sent some members of the Pistoian, Bianchi, and
Neri to Florence. The Whites were quartered in the
Frescobaldi palace, the Blacks in the house of certain
Cerchi, to whom they were related. But this measure
had a very unexpected result, for, as <span class="locked">Villani<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a></span> remarks,
even as one sick sheep infects another with disease, so
the Pistoians communicated their party hatred to the
Florentines, who thus became increasingly divided. At
all events, from that time the Donati were Blacks, the
Cerchi Whites.</p>

<p>Hence it may be clearly seen that this division of
parties no longer corresponds with that of the Guelphs
and Ghibellines. Principles are set aside and personal
passions and hatreds more and more dominant. But, in
the nature of things, no Florentine family at the time
could have a better claim to be entitled Ghibellines than
the Donati, a line boasting feudal descent, and connected
with the oldest nobility of the city and its territory. The
head of the house was Messer Corso, who, after the death
of his first wife, contracted a second marriage with one
of the Ubertini, an old Ghibelline family that had been
always opposed to the popular government, and seemed
to have the very blood of the tyrants of Romagna and
Lombardy in its veins. Yet it was principally through
Corso Donati that events again took another unexpected
turn. Spurred by his devouring ambition, he started a
secret intrigue with Boniface VIII. through his Roman
agents, the Spini, and the Pope believed that at last he
had found a man after his own <span class="locked">heart.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a></span> And before very
long these secret practices produced visible results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The Pope's purpose of exercising undue interference in
Florentine affairs was plainly seen when the question was
discussed as to revoking the banishment of Giano della
Bella. Though without any lawful voice in the matter, he
not only made violent opposition to the proposal, but
also, on January 23, 1296, addressed a letter to the
Florentines, threatening them with interdict, unless they
abandoned the <span class="locked">idea.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a></span> No one, however, was yet aware
that he had already formed a scheme, and was secretly
plotting to carry it into effect; nor did any one imagine
that <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Papa Bonifacius volebat sibi dari totam Tusciam</span></i>,<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a>
although this was afterwards ascertained to be the case,
and written proof of it is extant in an old document that
serves to explain his real <span class="locked">aims.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a></span> These were also formulated
clearly enough by the chronicler Ferreto, when he
wrote that Boniface meditated "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">faesulanum popolum
iugo supprimere, et sic Thusciam ipsam, servire desuetam,
tyrannico more comprehendere.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> In fact, in May, 1300,
the Pope had already sent word to the Duke of Saxony
that the Tuscan factions having infected his own States, it
was impossible for him to achieve any result without first
reducing Tuscany to subjection. And he continued that
although able to do this on his own authority, he nevertheless
preferred to gain the consent of the electoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
princes, and likewise that of Albert of Austria, king of
the Romans, to whom he forwarded a minute of the act
of <span class="locked">renunciation.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a></span> Donati, being privy to the scheme, had
hastened to assume the attitude of the most Guelph of all
Guelphs, and denounce the Cerchi as Ghibellines. Consequently
all who distrusted the Pope were increasingly
willing to join the Cerchi side.</p>

<p>Suddenly Florence was startled by receiving well certified
news of the clandestine intrigues Donati was carrying
on in Rome through the agency of the Spini. Messer
Lapo Salterelli, an advocate of much skill but doubtful
integrity, and always ready to go with the tide, came
before the magistrates accompanied by two personal
<span class="locked">friends,<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a></span> and publicly accused of treasonable attempts
against the State three Florentines domiciled in Rome
at Spini's bank, three "mercatores Romanam Curiam
<span class="locked">sequentes."<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a></span> Corso Donati was not in Florence at the
time, but at Massa Trabaria, a city in the States of the
Church and close to the Tuscan frontier, where he had just
been appointed rector by the Pope, a circumstance that
heightened suspicion, and made the danger appear all the
more serious and imminent. Determined to be on the
alert, without giving undue provocation to the Pope,
the magistrates immediately sentenced the three citizens
in question to pay heavy fines, but awaited fresh intelligence
before proceeding against all the other persons
undoubtedly concerned in the plot. To allay the suspicions
roused against him, the Pope should have now
maintained a prudent silence, but his impetuous nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
brooked no restraint. Therefore, giving vent to his fury,
he wrote on April 24, 1300, threatening excommunication
on the city for daring to sentence <i>his own familiars</i>, and
summoned the three accusers to come to Rome without
<span class="locked">delay.<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a></span> He gained nothing by this move&mdash;on the contrary,
Lapo Salterelli, having just been elected a prior, raised the
question of jurisdiction by denying his right of interference
with the internal affairs of the Republic. Meanwhile
Boniface had called Vieri de' Cerchi to Rome, for
the purpose of inducing him to make peace with Donati,
who had already arrived there. But Cerchi, without
betraying any knowledge of the trial, merely declared
that he bore no hatred to any man, and alleging other
vague excuses, declined the proposed reconciliation, thus
stirring the Pope's wrath to the highest <span class="locked">degree.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a></span> It was
naturally very important for him to pacify the nobles,
since this was the only means of compassing the subjection
of the people. But precisely on that account the people
preferred to keep them divided, and therefore throwing
its weight on the side of the Cerchi, vehemently urged
the latter to oppose the Donati.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Such was the state of public feeling on the day known
to some as the fatal May Kalend. According to an old
custom, the maidens of Florence greeted the coming of
spring in the year 1300 by performing a dance in the S<sup>ta</sup>
Trinità Square. Crowds flocked to the spot, struggling
for a better sight of the festivity. Certain youths on
horseback, both of the Bianchi and Neri factions, came
into collision while pressing to the front. Hot words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
were exchanged followed by blows, swords flashed out,
and many wounds were inflicted. Ricoverino de' Cerchi had
his nose slashed off, an injury naturally demanding mortal
revenge. So, in the same way that the Buondelmonti
tragedy was declared by the chroniclers to have given
birth to the Guelph and Ghibelline factions, this May-day
festival was now considered by others to be the origin of
the White and Black <span class="locked">factions.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a></span> Yet this, too, was only
the sudden outburst of long repressed passions, now raised
to boiling point by the plots of the Pope. In consequence
of these disturbances, the councils immediately
passed a decree (4th of May), granting the Signory full
powers to reduce the city to order; to enforce the Enactments
of Justice; to guard "the ancient, customary, and
continued independence of the Florentine Commune and
people, in present danger of being changed to servitude by
many perilous innovations <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">tam introrsum, quam etiam de
foris venientes</span></i>."<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> The concluding words clearly referred
to Boniface, and accordingly on the 15th of May the
Pope despatched from Anagni a most violent letter to the
bishop and the inquisitor of Florence. He made complaint
against those "children of iniquity who, in order to
turn the people from their submission to the Keys of St.
Peter, were spreading the rumour that he sought to
deprive the city of its power of jurisdiction, and diminish
its independence, whereas, on the contrary, he wished to
enlarge its freedom." But he then proceeded to cry:
"Is not the Pontiff supreme lord over all, and particularly
over Florence, which for special reasons is bound to be
subject to him? Do not emperors and kings of the
Romans yield submission to us, yet are they not superior
to Florence? During the vacancy of the Imperial throne,
did not the Holy See appoint King Charles of Anjou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
Vicar-general of Tuscany? Was he not recognised as
such by themselves? The Empire is now vacant, inasmuch
as the Holy See has not yet confirmed the election
of the noble Albert of Austria." And thus, in a rising
<i>crescendo</i>, he threatened the Florentines that, failing obedience,
"he would not only launch his interdict and excommunication
against them, but inflict the utmost injury on
their citizens and merchants, cause their property to be
pillaged and confiscated in all parts of the world and
release all their debtors from the duty of payment." He
again inveighed against the three audacious informers,
vowing to have them treated and punished as heretics,
and wrote with special acrimony of Lapo Salterelli for
having dared to declare that the Pope had no right to
meddle with the tribunals of the Commune. And he
wound up by insisting that the sentence on his three
familiars should be <span class="locked">annulled.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a></span></p>

<p>The Florentines refused to heed his words, and the Neri
then began to feel anxious, dreading lest the White, or, as
they already called it, the Ghibelline party, "should
be exalted in Florence, which, under pretence of good
government, already wore a Ghibelline <span class="locked">aspect."<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a></span> They
accordingly induced the Pope to send the Cardinal of
Acquasparta to arrange the pacification of the nobles.
The Cardinal arrived at the beginning of June, at once
requested full powers to conclude the agreement, and
likewise proposed that the Signory should be chosen by
lot, in order to avert the disturbances always accompanying
their <span class="locked">election.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a></span> The Florentines lavished verbal
promises on him, but refused to invest him with the
desired Balia. Previous experience had warned them
that peace between the nobles meant "ruin to the
people," and a fresh proof to this effect was afforded
at the moment. In fact, the Cardinal had barely begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
to dispose the nobles towards reconciliation, than they
rose to arms, and on St. John's Eve (23rd of June), almost
under the Cardinal's eyes, made a violent assault on the
Consuls of the Guilds, who were bearing offerings to the
shrine of the saint, and shouted while raining blows on
them: "We are the men that routed the foe at Campaldino,
yet you have driven us from office and power
in our own <span class="locked">city."<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a></span> So enormous an outrage demanded
heavy punishment, and as the Signory was then composed
of burghers of the White party, including Dante
Alighieri, it exiled several nobles of either side within
twenty-four <span class="locked">hours.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a></span></p>

<p>The Bianchi promptly obeyed the decree and withdrew
to Sarzana; but the Neri rebelled against it, and only
when threatened with worse chastisement, removed to
Castel della Pieve in the Perugian territory. It was said
that they had ventured to resist because they had the
Cardinal's permission to await help from Lucca, which after
all was never sent. And it was added that this succour
was withheld because the Florentines, gaining some inkling
of the scheme, had prepared for defence, and advised Lucca
to that effect. Whether this were true or false, it is an
ascertained fact that the public wrath was so hot against
the Cardinal, that the people aimed their crossbows at the
windows of the bishop's palace where he was lodged. One
of the bolts actually struck the beam of his ceiling, and
so greatly alarmed him, that after first removing to another
house he took his departure, leaving the city under interdict
and <span class="locked">excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a></span> Nevertheless, animosity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
riot continued to prevail; and before long the exiled
Bianchi were permitted to return. This indulgence was
accorded them, partly because the climate of Sarzana was
so unhealthy that Guido Cavalcanti contracted an illness
there, of which he subsequently died, but partly too because
the Bianchi nobles were on far better terms with the people.
The Neri, on the contrary, joined more actively than
before in the Pope's plots, and seconded by the Captains of
the Party, conspired for the purpose of trying conclusions
by force.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Boniface was pressingly urging Charles
of Valois, the king's brother, to march into Tuscany
from France, and Charles II. of Anjou had already
implored that prince to come to aid him in his
struggle with the Sicilians. The Valois was an
enterprising and cruel leader. During the Gascon
campaign of 1294 he had hung sixty citizens, and
slaughtered the inhabitants of Rèole after they had laid
down their arms. He had fought in Flanders at the
beginning of the year 1300, and after capturing various
cities, had compelled the reigning Court to open to him
the gates of Ghent. Then, after swearing in the name
of the king to restore his States, he nevertheless sent him
to Paris, and in violation of the oath he had taken,
annexed the county to <span class="locked">France.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></span> This was the man now
summoned to Florence by the Pope. To induce him to
come promptly and with good will, the Pope even dazzled
him with hopes of the imperial crown. In any case, by
right of the authority he asserted during the interregnum,
he would appoint him vicar-general and peacemaker in
Tuscany, "to enforce the execution of his purpose <span class="locked">there."<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a></span>
In what that purpose consisted, even Villani, who was on
his side, admits that Boniface intended "to crush the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a></span>
people and the <span class="locked">Whites."<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a></span> Accordingly the Blacks own
displayed great activity, with the aid of their adherents in
town and country. They held various meetings, of
which the most notorious and turbulent was that assembled
in June at Santa Trinità, for the purpose of urging the
Pope to send Charles of Valois to straighten their affairs,
and declaring that, for their own part, they were ready to
join him at any <span class="locked">cost.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a></span> Naturally all this could not be
kept secret, and in fact the Signory immediately sentenced
the conspirators to various penalties. Messer Corso, being
absent, was condemned in contumacy to confiscation as
well as personal punishment; some of the Blacks were
relegated to a fixed domicile; others mulcted in 2,000
lire each, and even their friends at Pistoia expelled from
that city, for the greater enfeeblement of the party.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charles of Valois marched across the Alps,
and the same summer was already in occupation of Parma,
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">cum magno arnese equorum et somariorum.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> Reaching
Bologna on the 1st of August he found convoys from the
Bianchi and the Neri awaiting him there. The latter party
had already handed over to the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">curia domini Papæ</span>" the
large sum of 70,000 florins to assist the expedition which
was now absolutely <span class="locked">decided.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a></span> As a preliminary step,
Valois went to Anagni with 500 knights, saw King Charles
of Naples, and made arrangements with him concerning
the Sicilian campaign. The Pope hastened to create Valois
Count of Romagna, and afterwards, in the name of the
vacant Empire, Mediator (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Paciaro</span></i>) in <span class="locked">Tuscany.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a></span> So,
without farther delay, the Court started for Florence,
joined on the road by the exiles who flocked to his ranks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
His mission was to crush the Bianchi and the people and to
uplift the Neri. He had deliberately undertaken the task,
but rather for the purpose of satisfying the Pope, of whose
support in Sicily the Angevins had now pressing need,
than from any personal motive. In fact, knowing that he
could never hope to be lord of Florence, he felt very little
interest in the matter. Nevertheless he counted on being
able to extort a considerable sum of money from the city,
and to this end brought Messer Musciatto Franzesi with
him to serve, Villani tells us, as his <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">pedotto</span></i>, <i>i.e.</i>, as guide
and factotum. This man was a well-known merchant of
the Florentine territory, who had made his fortune in
France by illegal as well as lawful means and had been
knighted by the French king in reward for many
services, among others for having suggested a device
for replenishing the treasury during the war in Flanders
by debasing the <span class="locked">coinage.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a></span> Charles of Valois hoped to gain
much by this man's assistance; whereas the Florentines
regarded the said <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">pedotto</span></i> with great distrust.</p>

<p>On the 13th of September all the councils assembled in
the palace of the Podestà&mdash;Dante Alighieri sitting among
them that day&mdash;to decide "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">quid sit providendum et
faciendum super conservatione Ordinamentorum Iustitiæ
et Statutorum Populi.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a> This, and not the struggle
between the Bianchi and Neri, was always the main point
with the Florentines. Hence it was resolved that, for the
present, everything should remain in the hands of the
magistrates of the Republic, and that it would be advisable
to dispatch an embassy to the Pope. Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a></span>
Dante Alighieri was one of the ambassadors sent, as
asserted by the historians, has been no less disputed than
all other incidents of the poet's life. At that time he was
ardently devoted to politics, and although belonging to
the old nobility, was not only enrolled in the guilds and
a partisan of the Bianchi, but thoroughly at one with the
people, a supporter of the Enactments of Justice, and
opposed to the Pope's designs. From the 15th of June
to the 15th of August, 1300, he had been one of the Priors
who had exiled the leaders of the Bianchi and the Neri.
In the "Consulte" of 1296 we find him combating the
proposal of furnishing a subsidy to Charles of Anjou, to
assist his Sicilian campaign. In 1301 he took an even
more prominent share in the debates of the councils, and
always manifested unchanged opinions. In fact, during
the debates of the 14th of April, when it was proposed
to supply a hundred soldiers at the expense of the
Commune, for the Pope's service, Dante twice, at least,
made reply, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quod de servitio faciendo domino Papæ
nihil fiat.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> He had been also frequently employed in
other public posts: accordingly it is quite possible that he
may have been sent to Rome at this time, as many of his
biographers have stated. What could be said to the
Pope? It was now hopeless to expect him to refrain
from sending Charles of Valois; but in addition to
soothing him with fair words, it might be neither inopportune
nor useless to endeavour to make him understand
that it could not serve his purpose to expel the
Bianchi and aggrandise the Neri, seeing that the government
of the city would still remain in the hands of the
guilds. It would, therefore, be wiser for him to come
to terms with the people, which was steadfastly Guelph,
and, once pacified, might consent, as in past times, to
accept from him, in the future, a provisional Vicar, always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
provided that the freedom of its popular government, its
statutes and enactments, were left intact. But this
popular government was precisely what the Pope was
determined not to tolerate any longer. Therefore, without
many words, and almost without giving any heed to
the ambassadors, he only replied to their arguments by
saying, so Compagni relates: "Make humiliation to us."
According to the same chronicler, two of the ambassadors
returned to Florence without delay, but Dante,
who was the third, lingered in Rome for a <span class="locked">while.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile Valois, with his usual deceit, and to hoodwink
every one more completely, wrote to the Commune
of San Gimignano on the 20th of September in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
following terms: "Be assured that neither the Pope nor
I have the slightest intention 'de juribus iurisdictionibus
seu libertatibus, quæ per comunitatis Tusciæ tenentur et
possidentur, in aliquo nos intromictere, sed potius ...
<span class="locked">favorare.'"<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a></span> The Florentines, however, were not to be
tricked by these false promises, and on the 7th of October
elected a new Signory, in advance of the usual time,
trying to assign either faction an equal share in it, in the
hope of effecting some mitigation of party rancour. But,
as justly observed by Compagni, this was rather the time
"for the sharpening of swords." Valois, being at Sienna
on the 14th, dispatched ambassadors thence to announce
his arrival, and these envoys were received by the councils
in full assembly, including that of the Guelph Society.
Accordingly many Neri and Grandi being present, and
joining with those who at every time and everywhere
invariably go with the winning side, they all vied warmly
with one another in proposing to welcome the stranger
with open <span class="locked">arms.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a></span> In point of fact, no one was inclined
to oppose what had now become an unavoidable necessity,
particularly as Charles had again given the Florentine
envoys at Sienna written as well as verbal assurances of
his intention to respect the city's laws and rights of <span class="locked">jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a></span>
So, on All Souls' Day, 1st of November,
welcomed with great pomp and display of force, Valois
entered Florence as "Peacemaker," and, as Villani says,
"with his men disarmed." But in the "Divina Commedia"
Dante describes his entry <span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container" xml:lang="it" lang="it">

<p>His troops had gained so many recruits by the way
as to now amount to about 800 foreign and 1,400 Italian
horse. They were certainly too few to besiege or enslave
Florence; but Valois had the influence of Rome
and France at his back, and the Neri were ready to fly
to arms. Hence, assured of safety, he established his
quarters across the river (Oltrarno) in the house of the
Frescobaldi, once friends, but now foes of the Cerchi.
After resting there quietly for a few days, in order to
mature his plans, he demanded the lordship and custody
of the city, with a view to its pacification. Accordingly
a solemn meeting was held in Santa Maria Novella on the
5th of November, attended by all the leading citizens
and magistrates of Florence. Valois's request was granted
when he pledged his princely word to preserve the city
in good order, peace, and independence. Villani, who
was present at the ceremony, and favourable to Charles,
relates, nevertheless, that "he" (Valois) "and his troops
immediately began to do the contrary." In fact, by the
advice of Musciatto Franzesi, who had connived with the
Neri to that effect, violence was resorted to without delay,
and all Florence rose in a tumult, perceiving that the
moment for assault and treachery had now arrived.</p>

<p>The Signory being attacked by the Neri, betrayed by
Charles and forsaken by the Bianchi on the charge of
having allowed itself to be surprised unprepared for
defence, was utterly powerless, and the Republic was left
without a government. The new Podestà, Messer Cante
dei Gabrielli of Gubbio, had entered the city with Charles
de Valois, and for what purpose may be easily divined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
At this juncture Corso Donati appeared, sword in hand,
with his followers at the Pinti gate. Finding it closed,
he managed to break through the postern door, with the
help of friends within, and, entering the city, was hailed
by the mob with the usual cries of "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Viva Messer Corso,
viva il Barone!</span>" Hastening first to throw open the
prisons, he then went to the Public Palace, and driving
out the Signory, compelled them to return to their homes.
Villani relates that "during all this laceration of the city,
Charles, violating the terms he had just sworn to observe,
never attempted to check the fray, but only looked <span class="locked">on."<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a></span>
The Bianchi were speedily overpowered, many wounded
and killed, and their houses sacked. This "pestilence
lasted for five days in Florence, and for eight in the
territory, armed bands scouring the country, maltreating
the inhabitants, and plundering and burning their
dwellings. Some of the worst and most ferocious excesses
were committed by the Medici <span class="locked">family.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a></span> By the
7th of November the Signory were so overwhelmed with
terror as to suggest a decree authorising them to withdraw
before the legal expiration of their term. Therefore
on the following day a new Signory was appointed
to hold office until the 14th of December, when, according
to the law, another one would have to be elected in regular
course. The existing Signory hastened to announce to
all the fortunate triumph of the Church party under
the auspices of the Pope and Valois, by whose means
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Populus roboratus, Status et Ordinamenta Iustitiæ,
iurisdictiones, honores et possessiones Populi et Comunis
Florentiæ suorumque civium observata.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> In spite of
these very hypocritical words, we know that even then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
no one dared attempt to annul the enactments, or to
remove the government from the grasp of the people;
while it was equally true that with a Signory composed
of Neri, a Podestà such as Cante dei Gabrielli and Valois,
with Musciatto Franzesi and Corso Donati at his elbow,
the Bianchi were doomed to destruction. In fact, the
work of pillage never ceased; exiled friends were recalled,
the banishment of adversaries was rigidly maintained,
and Charles began to extort money from the
citizens by <span class="locked">threat.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a></span> His first victims were the members
of the late Signory, who were given the choice of opening
their purses or being sent as prisoners to Puglia, an
alternative of which the meaning was <span class="locked">clear.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Pope having little confidence in Valois,
or in the latter's scanty knowledge of Florence, and still
adhering to his plan of reconciling the magnates in order
to crush the people, again sent the Cardinal of Acquasparta,
for the purpose&mdash;as stated in his letter dated 2nd of
December, 1301&mdash;"of seconding Charles's efforts, by
checking dissension among the citizens and converting
them to peace and <span class="locked">charity."<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a></span> These were vain hopes,
however. The Cardinal did his utmost, and arranged a
few reconciliations and even some marriages between
Bianchi and Neri; but when he proposed that either
party should have an equal share in the government, the
Neri, backed by Charles, made the most vehement opposition.
And as the Cardinal persisted in his fruitless
endeavours, Messer Niccolò de' Cerchi, when riding out
to the country for a day's pleasuring with his friends, was
attacked in Piazza Santa Croce, pursued by Corso
Donati's son Simone, and murdered by him on the Africo
bridge. But in the course of the struggle the victim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
dealt his assailant a mortal wound that soon brought him
also to the grave.</p>

<p>As Simone was Corso's favourite son, it may be
imagined how this effected the peace that the Pope had
hoped to establish through the Cardinal's mediation.
Messer Cante dei Gabrielli had already begun to pronounce
sentences on the Bianchi, which were subsequently
transcribed on the first pages of the still extant "Libro
del Chiodo." Four of the Bianchi faction were exiled on
the 18th of January, 1302; five more, including Dante
Alighieri, on the 27th. In February four other verdicts
were issued for the banishment of over one hundred
nobles and burghers of the city and <span class="locked">territory.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a></span> Enraged
by these proceedings, the Cardinal hurried off, again
leaving Florence under interdict, but not before he had
received the 1,100 florins assigned to him on the 27th of
February, 1302, in remuneration of his abortive efforts.</p>

<p>In the meantime Charles of Valois had gone to Rome,
though for what purpose is scarcely ascertained. Compagni
says that he went to seek money from the Pope,
who replied to him: "I have sent thee to the source of
gold; now profit by it as best thou canst." It is, therefore,
highly probable that he went to convince the Pope
of the impossibility of the pacification His Holiness had
dreamt of arranging, and that the only thing to be done was
to exalt the Neri and crush the Bianchi, together with the
people abetting them. Knowing little of the Italian
communes in general or of Florence in particular, he
failed to discern, that though the Bianchi might be
crushed, not so the people. To quell the latter, nothing
short of wholesale slaughter could suffice, and even this
would have failed in the long run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
At any rate, on returning to Florence on the 19th of
March, Valois feigned to have discovered that the Bianchi
had formed a plot against him with the connivance of
one of his barons, Pietro Ferrando of Provence; and an
agreement signed and sealed by the conspirators was
actually <span class="locked">produced.<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a></span> The chroniclers, Villani included,
declare that the plot was entirely fictitious; nevertheless,
the agreement in question, dated 26th of March, is still
extant in the Florentine <span class="locked">Archives.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a></span> Either it was forged
at the time to furnish an excuse for fresh arrangements,
or was drafted by Pietro Ferrando for the purpose of
entrapping the Bianchi and giving Charles another
weapon against them. In fact, he immediately subjected
them to fresh persecutions. The heads of the party were
cited to appear; but disregarding the summons, they
hastily fled to Pistoia, Arezzo, and Pisa, there reinforcing,
the Ghibellines and all other enemies of Florence. Eleven
of their number were outlawed as rebels; their houses and
property confiscated or destroyed.</p>

<p>Having dealt the Bianchi this fresh blow, and secured
the triumph of the Neri, Valois took his departure, but
not without obtaining a promise of further subsidies from
his friends. In fact 20,000 florins were awarded him in
December, and 5,000 more sent in October, <span class="locked">1303.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a></span> Meanwhile
the Podestà, Messer Cante, continued to rain
penalties on the town. By May no fewer than 250 condemnations
had been pronounced, and as his successor
pursued the same course, more than 600 sentences of
confiscation, exile, and death were issued during the year
<span class="locked">1302.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></span> Villani says in conclusion: "Thus by the agency
of Charles and the orders of Boniface VIII., the hated
Bianchi faction was defeated and expelled, wherefrom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
great trouble ensued later <span class="locked">on."<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a></span> Up to this point the
succession of events may be traced with sufficient ease.
But from the moment the exiles sought friends abroad,
and waged war on their native city, it became increasingly
difficult to disentangle the chaos of parties, and comprehend
the real meaning of all that took place. Therefore
this is the moment to test whether our previous
remarks have served to cast any new light upon a period
of history that is still somewhat obscure, in spite of the
close study and deep learning devoted by so many writers
to its investigation.</p>

<span class="subhead"><i>DANTE, FLORENTINE EXILES AND HENRY VII.</i></span></h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<div><img src="images/i_a.jpg" class="drop-capi" alt="" /></div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">AFTER</span> Valois's departure and the events
by which it was followed, the history of
Florence enters on a new phase. The
exiles united with the nobles of the
territory and the Ghibelline cities in
raising a rebellion against the Republic,
in order to pave the way for their own recall. This
naturally brought about a temporary reconciliation and
agreement between the magnates of the Black party, who
made greater boast than ever of being the only genuine
Guelphs, and stigmatised all the exiles as Ghibellines.
Pistoia and the fortress of Piantravigne were the first
to revolt, but were speedily reduced to submission.
Then, on the 8th of June, 1302, the leading exiles, of
whom Dante Alighieri was one, assembled in the church
of St. Godenzio among the Apennines, and arranged
explicit terms of alliance with the Ubaldini, undertaking
to compensate them at their own expense for the injuries
caused by the war to that family's possessions in the
Mugello, where the stronghold of Montaccenico was to
serve as headquarters for the adversaries of Florence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
Thereupon the Florentines at once proceeded to ravage
all the lands of the Ubaldini on either side of the <span class="locked">Apennines.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a></span>
By tremendous exertions, and with the support
of Pisa and Bologna, the exiles managed to collect an
army of 800 horse and 6,000 foot, and in the spring
of 1303 beleaguered the Castle of Pulicciano, appertaining
to the Florentines. But even there they had little success.
The "people and knights" of Florence took arms and
hastily marched against them. The Pisans failed to send
the promised succour, the Ubaldini remained inert, and
as the Bolognese withdrew declaring themselves betrayed,
the Bianchi, being left unassisted, ignominiously dispersed.
So the Neri returned to the city in triumph, after
taking many prisoners, some of whom were killed on the
way and others beheaded by the Podestà. They afterwards
surprised the Castle of Montale near Pistoia, and
ravaged the surrounding territory. Thus the war seemed
at an end, and the hopes of the exiles fallen.</p>

<p>But at this juncture discord again broke out in
Florence. Preliminary manifestations of turbulence and
rebellion had already led to some fresh sentences of exile
and a few executions. But matters now grew more
serious. Corso Donati's arrogance once more produced
its usual results. By disgusting his friends he drove
them to side with the rich burghers they despised. Being
alienated from the nobles of the territory who had made
common cause with the exiles, he tried again to become
the leader of the more intolerant section of the magnates,
and curried favour with the populace, declaring it to be
unjustly overtaxed, merely to fill the pockets of certain
fat burghers. "Let the people see where that great sum
has gone, for no such amount can have been expended on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
the war." And he demanded an inquiry, thus beginning,
as Villani remarks, "to sow discord by a feint of justice
and <span class="locked">compassion."<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a></span> Much discussion, great turmoil ensued,
but nothing was done, although a law was actually passed
(24th of July, 1303) granting the Podestà and captain
full powers of inquiry and decision. Meanwhile much
irritation was felt by the "fat burghers" against whom
the accusation had been launched, and in order to strike
a fresh blow at the magnates, they obtained the recall of
certain exiles belonging to the popular party, who had not
broken bounds. They likewise recalled a few of the
Cerchi family, thereby gaining the approbation of the
Pope, who was much troubled by the disturbances the
Bianchi were exciting on all sides and even in cities
belonging to the <span class="locked">Church.<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a></span> Thus, as Del Lungo happily
expresses it, "by dint of fishing magnates out of the
<span class="locked">crucible,"<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a></span> Corso Donati was enabled to gather about
him more than thirty families, including some of the
burgher class and a few returned exiles. Several members
of the Tosinghi house were adherents of the Bianchi, and
amongst them the valiant Baschiera della Tosa was one
of the exiles. There were also Donati's former foes, the
Cavalcanti, a very wealthy and numerous clan, comprising
members of all parties, although more Bianchi than Neri,
and who, as the owners of a mass of houses, shops, and
magazines in the centre of the city and tenanted by
merchants, were naturally on good terms with the trading
class. Accordingly the Donati no longer commanded a
party, but rather an ill-assorted crowd, only united by
the common bond of hatred against the people. In fact,
Messer Corso was wont to say that they were all "captive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
and enslaved to a herd of fat burghers, or rather dogs,
who tyrannised over them and robbed them of <span class="locked">power."<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a></span>
Nevertheless, the real magnates, namely, noblemen by
birth and temper, mostly leaned to his side, while those
unable to tolerate his insolence preferred to play the part
of spectators. Another of Corso's allies was Messer
Lottieri della Tosa, Archbishop of Florence, who was
making warlike preparations within the walls of his palace.
In opposition to these confederates, several families, such
as the Spini, Pazzi, Gherardini, and certain of the Frescobaldi
had banded together under the lead of Messer Rosso
della Tosa, another man of soaring ambition, who, in
pursuance of the policy formerly employed by Vieri dei
Cerchi, inclined to the burghers' side. And by means of
some of his bravest followers, more particularly certain
democrats of the Neri party, named Bordoni, "serving
him," Compagni says, "as pincers to seize hot <span class="locked">iron,"<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a></span> he
daily harassed the Donati in the councils of the State.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Thus matters seemed again at the same point as before
the arrival of Valois. In fact, we see Rosso della Tosa
and his following combining with the people in defence
of the Signory; while, on the other hand, Donati, backed
by the captains of the party, was continually threatening
and attacking it. Again, the citizens daily drew swords
and came to blows; again, robbery, bloodshed, murder,
and arson were rife in the town and throughout the territory.
Even from the tower of the bishop's palace a
mangonel hurled stones on Corso Donati's foes. Both
the Signory and Podestà were reduced to impotence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
Things reached at last such a pitch that recourse was
had to the very strange plan of transferring the government
to the Lucchese for sixteen days to see whether they
could succeed in quieting the city. They re-established
order, but without punishing the guilty; consequently,
as soon as they were gone everything went on as before.
It was even endeavoured to choose a Signory (solely of the
people, however) approved by both parties, but the
attempt came to <span class="locked">nothing.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a></span> What brought the confusion
to a climax, and rendered it permanent, was the fact that
whereas the split between the magnates and the people
had caused two genuine parties to be formed, the division
among the magnates now convulsing the city, solely
proceeded from the ambition of Corso Donati and a few
others, had no political motive, and no basis of general
principle or general interest. As we have seen, in fact,
Donati's following comprised magnates of every shade,
returned exiles owning friends and relations still in banishment,
together with a sprinkling of the lower class. Nor
could there be much cohesion in the ranks of the adverse
party supporting the Signory, since this was also made up
of aristocrats and men of the people, conflicting elements
whose union could never be permanently assured. If the
foes of the Signory were held together by Corso's energy
and ambition, its supporters were chiefly united by their
common hatred for him. Therefore, owing to this predominance
of the personal element, both the parties were
exposed to perpetual division, subdivision, and change, to
a perpetual shifting of the pieces, and restless passing and
repassing from one group to another.</p>

<p>Confusion was now to be heightened by the death of
Boniface VIII. (October 11, 1303) and the election of
Pope Benedict XI., a man of gentler fibre and uncertain
will. The new pontiff yearned to re-establish peace in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
Florence at all costs, and procure the recall of its exiles;
for the latter were keeping his own states in a turmoil,
and even in Rome itself he had already encountered so
much opposition from the nobles and people, that shortly
after his election he had been compelled to seek refuge
at Perugia, namely, on the borders of disturbed, restless
Tuscany. Nor was it now possible, amid all these
calamities, to count on any help from France, inasmuch
as he had brought a suit against the authors of the
criminal attempt at Anagni causing the death of Pope
Boniface, that had been actually devised by the king of
the French. For these reasons, and at the earnest solicitation
of the Bianchi in Florence and elsewhere, Pope
Benedict dispatched a peacemaker to the city on the 31st
of January, 1304, in the person of Cardinal da Prato, a
supposed Ghibelline. The Cardinal arrived on the 10th
of March, and tried to conciliate all alike; magnates,
people, exiles, Bianchi, the Neri led by Corso Donati and
the Neri under Rosso della Tosa. But what chiefly
disturbed public feeling and brought confusion to a
climax was his scheme of recalling banished men and
reconciling them with the city. Nevertheless the popular
class was less opposed than others to the plan, discerning
in it a possible means of enfeebling the magnates by
promoting fresh discord in their ranks. Rosso della
Tosa, on the contrary, was decidedly hostile to the
exiles' return, considering that this would strengthen
the opposite party, which was already favourable to many
of the banished men. These views were shared by some
of his faction. On the excuse of suffering from an
attack of gout, Corso Donati remained a passive spectator
for the nonce. But the Cavalcanti warmly approved of
the suggested treaty, and were seemingly the first to
promote it.</p>

<p>Having received full powers from the people, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
Cardinal at once began to arrange reconciliations, and
with success as regarded the Bishop and his former
comrade, Messer Rosso della Tosa. He next appointed
Corso Donati Captain of the Guelph Society, and reorganised
the old popular militia, on the original plan,
under nineteen Gonfaloniers of Companies. But in spite
of bestowing commands on some of the magnates, the
latter murmured bitterly against his reforms, saying that
they tended to increase the people's strength, that the
Cardinal was a Ghibelline, would end by leaving the
city in the hands of the Bianchi, and that the latter
would forthwith claim restitution of all property and
estates made confiscate for the benefit of the Guelph
Society. Regardless of these complaints, the Cardinal
persisted in holding meetings to ratify the agreement.
In fact, on the 26th of April, several Neri of the Donati
and Tosa factions exchanged pledges of amity in the
Square of Santa Maria Novella. Great festivities were
given in honour of the occasion, among others a grand
performance arranged by the Company of Borgo San
Frediano, who announced throughout Florence that all
persons desiring news of the other world might obtain it
by assembling on the banks of the Arno on the evening
of the 1st of May. Blazing fireworks represented the
infernal regions, while boatloads of masks figured as
condemned souls undergoing various torments. The
people flocked in vast numbers to the river and on to
the Carraia Bridge, which being only a wooden structure
at the time, gave way beneath their weight. Many were
seriously injured, and many others really went to the
next world. The catastrophe was regarded by all as a
bad omen, and was truly the prelude of fresh calamity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, those most opposed to the recall of the
exiles craftily advised the Cardinal to begin by undertaking
a mission of peace to Pistoia, declaring that so
long as that city remained in the power of the Bianchi,
Florence could never be really pacified. But the Pistoians
resisted his efforts so vigorously, that not only was he
compelled to leave the town without concluding any
arrangement, but on seeking to enter Prato, found the
gates of his native city closed in his face. The Pope,
being highly enraged by all this, addressed an indignant
letter to the Florentines on the 29th of <span class="locked">May.<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a></span> But they
were in so disorderly and riotous a state, that after
imploring the Pontiff to find them a Podestà, they
refused to accept either of the four individuals proposed
by him. Yet the Cardinal obstinately clung to his idea
of re-establishing peace. At his instance, safe conducts
were given to twelve delegates from the exiles, six
Ghibellines and six Bianchi, in order that they might
come to Florence to settle terms with as many representatives
appointed by the City, each Sesto contributing one
of the Donati and one of the adverse <span class="locked">faction.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a></span> These
twenty-four citizens were all magnates, and felt so much
reciprocal distrust that the twelve exiles, although well
received by the people and quartered under State protection
in the Cardinal's own residence at the Mozzi
Palace, were most anxious to depart, fearing to be cut to
pieces at any moment. But they were advised by their
friends to take arms and seek refuge in the houses of the
Cavalcanti, seeing that with the latter's help they would
be enabled, if necessary, to repulse and overcome their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
enemies by force. The Cavalcanti seemed well disposed
to the plan, and began to arrange preliminaries. But
after thus rousing the suspicion and increasing the
animosity of their foes, they suddenly drew back, thereby
disgusting even their friends. Accordingly on the 8th
of June, 1304, the exiles hurried away from Florence as
though flying for their <span class="locked">lives.<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a></span> Thereupon there was a
loud outcry against the Cardinal; he was charged with
having betrayed the city by his stealthy manœuvres, and
it was even added that he had encouraged the exiles to
appear before the walls in warlike array. Letters bearing
his seal were shown, and it was affirmed that the exiles
had marched from the Mugello as far as Trespiano,
and only beaten a retreat on learning the failure of the
meditated scheme. Villani declares that these reports
were mere <span class="locked">slanders;<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a></span> but even the epistles attributed to
Dante Alighieri lead us to infer that the Cardinal really
desired the exiles' return and had negotiated with them
to that <span class="locked">effect.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a></span> But his patience being now exhausted, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
departed on the 10th of June, again leaving the city under
interdict, and exclaiming: "Since ye prefer to be at war
and accursed, will neither hear nor obey the messenger of
God's Vicar, nor be at rest and at peace among yourselves,
remain under the curse of Heaven, under the curse of

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
At this moment the Cavalcanti and their friends were
at a truly terrible pass. Their present junction with the
Donati was insufficient to blot out old animosities, which
had been only laid aside for a while in order to second the
return of the Bianchi, at the expense of the Tosinghi
faction. The latter remained practically isolated, forsaken
even by the rich trading class, who, wearied of
perpetual civil war, had been persuaded by the Cardinal
to promote a reconciliation between the Cavalcanti and
Donati. But the former's unexpected withdrawal at the
last moment, and when all seemed arranged, had stirred
the old hatred to new fury, and the Cavalcanti were now
between two fires. Messer Corso, being unwilling to join
hands with the Tosinghi, kept his rage in check for the
nonce, and feigning to be ill with gout, still remained
passive, leaving his followers to do as they chose. But
Rosso della Tosa was a ferocious enemy of the Cavalcanti,
by whom he had been brought to the verge of ruin,
and his hatred was not to be restrained. So the Cardinal
had scarcely disappeared before a catastrophe became imminent
in Florence. The Cavalcanti recognised their peril;
but they were numerous, courageous, and powerful. They
could count on the Gherardini, Pulci, and Cerchi del Garbo;
they owned many friends even outside the walls and among
the exiled Bianchi; they had also adherents of the burgher
class, no few of whom tenanted their houses in the centre of
Florence. The foes now arming against the Cavalcanti were
aristocrats, not <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i>. The Cerchi del Garbo began to
scuffle day and night with the Giugni. The Cavalcanti
and their friends hastened to the former's assistance, and
so effectively as to be able to press on from Or San
Michele to Piazza San Giovanni almost unopposed. But
while at this distance from their own quarter a serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>
fire broke out there. Their enemies had set the Cavalcanti
houses ablaze with combustibles kept in readiness for
some days past. The first man to start the fire, beginning
with the dwellings of fellow associates, was Neri
degli Abati, prior of San Piero Scheraggio; and his
incendiary example was followed by many accomplices,
including Simone della Tosa and Sinibaldo Donati, Messer
Corso's <span class="locked">son.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a></span> It was the 10th of June, 1304, and a
strong north wind was blowing. Accordingly, the fire
spread with great rapidity to the Calimala street, the Old
Market, and Or San Michele, thus destroying the whole
centre of Florence as well as the Cavalcanti houses&mdash;in
fact, as Villani expresses it, "all the marrow, the yolk, and
dearest spots of our city of <span class="locked">Florence."<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a></span> He adds, that
the palaces, houses and towers consumed amounted to
more than seventeen hundred, with enormous loss of
property and merchandise, seeing that everything saved
from the fire was stolen when carried away, and that
fighting and pillage went on even in the midst of the
<span class="locked">flames.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a></span> Paolino Pieri relates in his chronicle, that one-tenth
of the city was burnt, and one-sixth of its whole property.
Many families and associations were ruined, but
the worst sufferers were the Cavalcanti, who seemed paralysed
with terror on beholding all their possessions devoured
by the flames. Yet so ferocious was the hatred
cherished against them, that even after these cruel calamities
they were driven from Florence as rebels.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Let us see what were the political consequences of these
events. The Donati and Della Tosa factions having
combined for the undoing of the Cavalcanti and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a></span>
friends, it was decided at first that the magnates, emboldened
by union and victory, should next attempt to
annul the Enactments of Justice, and take the government
in their hands. And, in the midst of the General dismay,
the project might have succeeded, Villani says, had the
nobles been really in unison. Instead, "they were all at
strife, and split into sects, wherefore either side courted
the people so as not to lose <span class="locked">ground."<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a></span> The division of
parties remained substantially the same. That is, on the
one hand, there were the quarrelsome magnates seeking
support from the people against their personal foes, and,
on the other, the people trying to profit by the magnates'
dissensions. Of course the merchants had also suffered
heavily by the fire; but their wealth was of a kind to be
rapidly replaced, whereas the nobles had no means of repairing
their still greater losses. For the prosperity of the
Florentine people was so prodigious at the time that, even
after this wholesale destruction, their riches seemed nowise
diminished. But there was a notable decline in the power
of the magnates, who disappeared almost entirely from
the first circuit, or centre of the city, where the old
families had their dwellings. Therefore Capponi has
some reason to say in his history: "From that moment
the supremacy of the nobles seems to have been uprooted,
and new social orders <span class="locked">established."<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a></span> Thus, as always
happened in Florence, even this great calamity proved
advantageous to the people.</p>

<p>In consequence of these lamentable events, added to
the reports sent by Cardinal da Prato to the Pope in
Perugia, the Holy Father cited twelve leading magnates of
Florence to appear before him there. Among the persons
thus summoned were Corso Donati and Rosso della<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
Tosa, once bitter enemies but now friends for the moment.
They set out towards Perugia with a great train of followers,
forming a mounted company of five hundred men
in all. So the exiles considered this a most favourable
opportunity for making a fresh attempt to re-enter their
native city. As usual, it was rumoured that the Cardinal
had encouraged them to expect a good reception; and it
was further announced that he had instigated Pisa, Bologna,
Arezzo, Pistoia, and the whole of Romagna to come to
their aid. But although some of the exiles' direst foes
were absent from Florence at the time, on the other hand,
the position of their adversaries must have been considerably
strengthened by the slaughter of the Cavalcanti
and Gherardini. Likewise, although the Greater Guilds
had once been induced to favour the return of banished
men, and particularly those of the popular class, it was
not to be expected that they would now be disposed to
welcome exiles advancing on Florence under the wing of
the Pisans, and joined with the Ghibellines of Tuscany and
Romagna. This league with the enemies of the State
naturally roused all Florence against them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the exiles seemed very hopeful. Thanks
to their new allies, they had contrived to collect an army
of 9,000 foot and 1,600 horse, and on the 19th of July
marched into Lastra, to await other reinforcements from
Pistoia. These were to be commanded by Tolosato degli
Uberti, a valiant Ghibelline leader, of an ancient Florentine
house, persistently hated by the Guelphs, in memory of
the rout at Montaperti. As Uberti failed to appear, the
exiles resolved to move on without him; but the twenty-four
hours' delay had sufficed to destroy their chance of
taking Florence by surprise. In fact, only twelve hundred
horse rode to the city in peaceful array, bearing olive
boughs in their hands; and passing the unfinished girdle
of new walls, halted beneath the old bastions, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
Cafaggio fields, between St. Mark's and the Church of
the Servi. There, on the 20th of July, panting from
fatigue, without water, and exposed to the burning sun,
they vainly waited for the gates to be opened to them.
Meanwhile a small band of their men had managed to
enter the city by forcing the Spadai gate, and advanced as
far as Piazza San Giovanni. But instead of finding friends
there, they were met by 200 horse and 500 foot, who drove
them back, capturing some of their number, and leaving a
good many wounded and slain. This gave the signal for
a retreat, soon converted into a general flight. The force
waiting at Cafaggio, exhausted from hunger and heat
combined, had already thrown down their weapons and
dispersed with "bands of volunteers" in pursuit. Many
were killed or died of fatigue, others were stripped, seized
and strung up on trees. News of the defeat reached
Lastra before the fugitives returned; accordingly those
encamped there took to flight, and although Tolosato
degli Uberti met them on the way, he found it impossible
to rally them to the attack. Among other narratives of
the affair we have that of Villani, who witnessed all that
occurred in <span class="locked">Florence.<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a></span> Dante Alighieri was not with the
army at Lastra, having separated from his companions in
exile shortly before, and almost in anger. He was probably
disgusted by their hybrid alliance with all the
enemies of Florence, by the secret agreements set on
foot between Donati and the Cavalcanti, and saddened
by the internecine slaughter so blindly provoked in the
vain expectation of compassing the recall of a few banished
<span class="locked">men.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
The victory at Lastra must have undoubtedly augmented
the daring and power of the magnates. It may have been
on this account that certain of their number now insisted
on their names being erased from the rolls of the <span class="locked">guilds.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a></span>
Additional proof to this effect is furnished by another
important event occurring on the 5th of August, 1304.
One of the Adimari having perpetrated a crime, was
brought before the Podestà to be judged. But his
associates made a violent assault on that magistrate as he
was leaving the Priors' palace, and after wounding or killing
several of his escort, broke into the prison and rescued
the criminal. Thereupon the Captain of the People, Messer
Gigliolo da Prato, temporarily acting as Podestà (since
the continual disturbances in the city had deterred every
one from assuming that office), departed from Florence in
high indignation. Accordingly, to provide for the due
administration of justice, the Florentines were obliged to
elect a committee of twelve citizens, one noble and one
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolano</span></i>, from every Sesto, to fulfil the duties of a Podestà.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a>
Presently, however, the resumption of hostilities outside
the walls reduced the city to quiet for a time.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The exiles had again begun to scour the land, stirring
neighbouring strongholds to revolt; and the Florentines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
instantly marched against them. The first place to be
attacked was the castle of Stinche, which had been incited
to rebel by the Cavalcanti. Its reduction was easily effected
(August, 1304), and all the captives were lodged in the
new prisons, henceforth entitled the "Stinche." A more
serious expedition had to be undertaken in 1305 against
Pistoia, when it rose to arms in the Bianchi cause, aided
by Arezzo and Pisa, and under the command of Tolosato
degli Uberti. A long and vigorous siege was the result.
The beleaguering force of Florentines and Lucchese was
led by Duke Robert of Calabria, who, as Captain of the
League, had furnished a large contingent of foot and 300
Catalan <span class="locked">horse.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a></span> The town held out during the whole
winter, but in April, 1306, the Pistoiese were compelled
to surrender from famine. Their walls and towers were
demolished, their territory divided between the Florentines
and Lucchese. Pope Clement V. had vainly endeavoured
to put an end to this war which dealt another cruel blow
to the Tuscan Ghibellines. He was a native of France,
had transferred the papal see to Avignon, and had no
knowledge of Italy. Nor could Italy feel any love for
an alien Pope who had deserted Rome. In fact, the
Florentines declined to listen to the messengers of peace
he despatched to their camp, and paid no heed to the
interdict he launched against them. For although the
Duke of Calabria withdrew, this was only a feint, seeing
that he left them all his men under the command of
Captain Pietro de la Rat. So the campaign was carried
on to the end.</p>

<p>Nor did the other envoy of peace, Cardinal Napoleon
Orsini, meet with any better fortune, for he was not only
ill received in Tuscany and Romagna, but robbed of his
goods and even in danger of his life. As for his excommunications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
interdicts, and counsels of peace, every one
laughed at them. The Florentines were determined to
do the work thoroughly, and even before the conclusion
of the war with Pistoia, started another expedition against
the formidable castle of Montaccenico, chief stronghold of
the Ubaldini, dominating the whole of the Mugello and
serving as the exiles' headquarters. By dint of scattering
bribes among the Ubaldini themselves, the Florentines
finally won the castle by treason, and, after reducing it to
ruin, immediately resolved to plant the towns of Scarperia
and Firenzuola in its vicinity, "to serve as scarecrows to
the Ubaldini, and harbours of refuge to faithful subjects."
All willing to inhabit the little town founded for that
purpose, were to be exempt from every form of vassalage.
The first stone of Scarperia was laid, without delay, on
the 7th of September, 1307; but the construction of
Firenzuola was postponed to a much later date (1332).</p>

<p>We must now consider what was the object the Republic
had in view, and what it achieved by means of these continual
campaigns, in which even the magnates took a part; what
too by the reduction of Ghibelline cities, and the destruction
of castles throughout the whole territory? On the one
hand, its political predominance in Tuscany was rapidly
increased, and new outlets of commerce acquired; while,
on the other, the power of the magnates outside Florence
was overthrown by the aid of those within the walls, who,
in their blind fury against the exiles, did not realise what
they were doing. The Florentines of old had demolished
the castles, which at one time reached nearly to their gates;
they had forced the barons to dwell in the city, had subjected
them to republican laws, and lowered their pride
by excluding them from the government. Profiting by
their disputes, the citizens had next spurred them to
destroy one another; and, in conclusion, were now making
them turn their weapons against more distant nobles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
and overthrow the latter's strongholds in the Casentino,
Mugello, and valley of the Arno. All this was invariably
advantageous to the guilds and the people. Therefore,
in 1306, while the Pistoian campaign was still going on,
the Florentines reorganised citizen-armed bands under
nineteen Gonfalonieri. This was the constitution of "the
good Guelph people," a reform made, according to
Villani, "in order to prevent the 'Grandi' and other
powerful folk from presuming to show arrogance on
the strength of having gained many victories over the
Bianchi and <span class="locked">Ghibellines."<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a></span></p>

<p>But this was not all, for the real gist of the new
reform consisted in the law of the 23rd of December,
1306, by which the enactments were strengthened and
an Executor of Justice was appointed to enforce their
more rigorous application. The object of the law was
clearly expressed by the introductory words explaining
that it was intended "to preserve the liberties of the
Florentine people, and break the pride of iniquitous men,
which has swollen to such extent that our eyes fail to
discern its limits."</p>

<p>In point of fact, the guilds showed no mercy to
the magnates, even when fighting side by side with
them against common foes. The "Executor" was
required to be a Guelph, a man of the people, and a
foreigner, <i>i.e.</i>, of non-Tuscan birth, from some city or
place, subject to no lord, and not less than eighty miles
from Florence. He was neither to be a knight nor a
<i>law judge</i>, a prohibition caused by the growing hatred
against <i>perverse judges</i> and fatal experience of recent
Podestàs. The "Executor" was to remain in office for
six months, and he was to bring with him one judge, two
notaries, twenty <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">masnadieri</span></i>, or guards&mdash;all of whom were
to be Guelphs and aliens&mdash;and two war-horses. His office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
was to protect the people and all the weak against powerful
personages, and to call the companies to arms whenever
any crime should be committed, for the prompt
enforcement of the penalties prescribed. It was to be
his special duty to ensure the due execution of the
Enactments of Justice, and whenever the Podestà or
Captain failed to do their part, he was instantly to
assume their functions according to the rules minutely
laid down in the new law, that was henceforth an
integral portion of the <span class="locked">enactments.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a></span> He was likewise
to deal punishment on all frauds and dishonest tricks
practised in the offices of the Commune. Should the
Podestà fail to demolish buildings (churches always
excepted) in which conventicles or meetings had been
illegally held, he was to enforce the said demolition, and
impose a fine of 500 <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lire</span></i> on the Podestà. Capital
punishment was to be inflicted on all who held meetings,
to plot treason against liberty or the popular
government. In such case, if nobles were concerned the
penalty was to be adjudged by the Podestà, and should
the Podestà hesitate to act, the Executor was to mulct
him as usual, and assume his functions. When the guilty
were <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i> the Executor alone was to condemn them
to death and degrade their descendants to the rank of
nobles. Likewise all <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i> accessory to crimes perpetrated
by nobles were to be condemned by the Executor
to double the penalty prescribed by the common law.
It was also the Executor's task to examine the actions of
the outgoing Podestà and Captain, and he, in due turn,
was subjected to investigation by persons appointed by
the Priors and Gonfaloniers of the <span class="locked">Companies.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span></p>
<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile the Pope's anxiety being stirred by the
increasing agitation provoked by the Florentine exiles,
throughout Romagna and the Marches, as well as in
Tuscany, again began to insist upon peace. But the
person charged to open negotiations to this effect was
Cardinal Orsini, a man of strong party feeling and
doubtful integrity. For when at Arezzo in 1307, he
had called there, in addition to the Florentine exiles,
many adherents of his own from the adjoining States of
the Church, thus assembling a force of 1,700 cavalry
and a great number of foot soldiers. It appears that he
had come to terms with Corso Donati and received
money from him for the undertaking in view. Messer
Corso, whose ambition was still unassuaged, had married
a third time, and was now related, through his wife, with
the Ghibelline lord, Uguccione della Faggiuola. This
circumstance naturally exposed him to much suspicion on
the part of the Guelphs, and accordingly, being even
more angered and discontented than before, he was again
bitterly hostile to Messer Rosso della Tosa and his
followers, who in their turn, and as an inevitable consequence,
had again combined with the wealthier burghers.
Hence, the latter, on noting the Cardinal's preparations,
and Donati's new manœuvres, speedily collected an army of
3,000 horse and 15,000 foot, and without further hesitation
marched towards Arezzo, ravaging the enemies'
lands by the way. Thereupon, by way of displaying
his military tactics, the Cardinal directed his march on
Florence through the Casentino. But as the Florentines
outwitted him, by doubling back and reaching the city
before him, he was obliged to retreat to Arezzo in a
very crestfallen mood. He then opened negotiations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
with the Florentines, who, feigning willingness to
entertain his proposals, despatched two ambassadors to
gull him with fair words. Compagni remarks that "no
woman was ever more flattered and then abused by
betrayers than he (the Cardinal) by those two <span class="locked">knights."<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a></span>
So that all he could do was to go off with his tail between
his legs, once more leaving the city under sentence of
<span class="locked">excommunication.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a></span> In revenge for this, the Florentines
imposed fresh taxes on the clergy, punishing those who
refused to <span class="locked">pay.<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a></span></p>

<p>The worst sufferer was Corso Donati, for the Cardinal,
after extracting money from him by promising to come
to Florence to crush Della Tosa and his Black faction,
had not even dared to approach the walls. But without
acknowledging his defeat, Donati immediately plunged
into fresh and more daring schemes. After a short
absence from Florence, probably to gain funds and
allies, he returned there in 1308. Increasingly blinded
by party passion, counting on assistance from his father-in-law,
Uguccione della Faggiuola, now lord of Arezzo,
as well as from Prato and Pistoia, he called a meeting
of his adherents in Florence. After explaining his hopes
and vowing to do away with the Enactments of Justice,
he urged them to draw their swords and make an end
of those Neri, who, after receiving so much help from
him and gaining victory by his means, now treated him
so iniquitously. But the rumour being already abroad
that he expected aid from that bitterest foe of Florence&mdash;the
formidable Uguccione&mdash;the popular feeling against
him was excited to the highest <span class="locked">pitch.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a></span> After being
repressed for some time the general fury burst out all
at once, and took Donati unawares. Suddenly, on the
6th of October, 1308, the Signory sounded the alarm-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>bell,
and the people, rising to arms, united with the Della
Tosa faction, other friendly magnates, and De la Rat's
Catalan troops. Donati was denounced to the Podestà,
Piero della Branca of Gubbio, as a traitor to his country,
and in less than an hour he was accused, tried, and
condemned. Immediately afterwards, the Signory, Podestà,
Captain, and Executor, with their respective familiars,
the Catalan troops, knights, and citizen-trained bands,
marched to St. Piero Maggiore to attack the Donati
houses. But Messer Corso and his friends resisted so
valiantly, that had Uguccione and the others fulfilled
their promise of coming to the rescue in time, the affair
might have taken an ugly turn. It is supposed that the
Aretines were already on the march, when, hearing that
all Florence had risen against Donati, they decided to
turn back. At all events, no succour arrived, and Messer
Corso soon found that even many of his Florentine
friends had ceased to defend the chain barricades, and
relinquished the struggle. Thereupon the people broke
through, and soon demolished the houses he had been
forced to abandon. Accompanied by a few devoted
adherents, he fled from the town by the Croce gate, with
the citizens and Catalans in hot pursuit. The first man
captured on the banks of the Africo was Gherardo dei
Bordoni, who was instantly slain. Next, the crowd cut
off his hand and nailed it on the door of the Adimari
house, because Tedici degli Adimari had first instigated
the dead man to join with Donati. A few moments later
the Catalans overtook Donati himself at San Salvi, and
in obedience to orders killed him on the spot. According
to another version of the tale, he first tried to bribe them
to spare his life, but without success; so, to avoid falling
into the hands of his Florentine foes, he cast himself
on the ground and was dispatched by a spear-thrust in
the throat. The monks of San Salvi bore away his dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
body, and the following day buried him in the
Badia without any pomp for fear of provoking the
public <span class="locked">wrath.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a></span></p>

<p>The cause of this sudden and irresistible burst of
popular fury is clearly explained by the letters which the
Commune shortly addressed to the Lucchese, in whose
territory the Bordoni had found refuge. "It is known
to all Tuscany that the Donati had planned a war to the
death, in order to give the city of Florence and the
Guelph party into the hands of the Ghibellines, and subject
to their yoke, to the utter extermination and destruction
of the Guelph Government. Those rebels intended
to break all bounds, and subdue the city to their rule,
although Messer Corso and his followers shamelessly
styled the Signory Ghibelline <span class="locked">instead."<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a></span> These words
were written by the Signory in March, 1309. In fact,
the Neri being split into Donati and Tosinghi factions,
and the latter having united with the wealthier burghers,
from whom could the Donati hope assistance, save from
the Ghibellines? The lower class of the people was
weak, and the distant Pope increasingly urged the return
of the exiles. The latter had now combined with Donati's
whilom allies, the nobles of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, standing aloof
from many of the burgher Bianchi, who had been expelled at
the same moment, but were gradually permitted to return;
and they had also separated from all independent men,
such as Dante Alighieri. The poet, in fact, being opposed
to Donati, and a promoter of the Enactments of Justice, had
been finally driven to adopt an individual attitude. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
the Bianchi, though exiled for having sided with the people,
were now on the side of the magnates, the Ghibellines,
Uguccione, and even of Corso Donati, the only person
likely to profit by so hybrid an alliance. Accordingly his
death had the immediate result of giving another terrible
shock to the magnates' power, both within and without
the city. Speedy proof was afforded of this when, at the
beginning of 1309, the proud Ubaldini came to make
submission to the Florentine Commune, promising to
guard the passes of the Apennines, and supporting their
offer by fitting guarantees of good faith. In consequence
of this they were accepted as friends, with the condition,
"that in every act and deed they should behave as good
subjects and <span class="locked">citizens."<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout the whole of its history the Florentine
Commune invariably adopted this plan when admitting
nobles to its midst. But it had also the effect of enabling
conquered and subject magnates to gain increased strength
in the city itself. Therefore, first without and then
within the walls, they unceasingly combated the people
and the Republic, down to the distant time when they
were finally crushed by the State. If Florentine prosperity
as yet showed no signs of diminution during the
sanguinary struggle now described, it was for two reasons
which should be duly kept in mind. The successive conflicts
we have narrated, all proceeded from the constant
necessity of preserving the merchant-republic from the
impact of the extraneous feudal body threatening to check
its natural growth. These civil wars, however, were
carried by a comparatively small number of citizens,
eager to gain possession of a government that had far
less influence on society than is generally supposed. The
true motive-power of the Republic proceeded less from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
the Signory, which was changed every two months, than
from the commercial and political constitution of the
guilds, which were firmly organised and, so far, thoroughly
in unison. The conditions of an all-absorbing modern
State, wherein every shock affects society at large, had
not yet sprung to life in the Middle Ages. The
Italian republics were miniature confederacies of separate
associations, under a central government of so feeble a
kind, that even when totally suppressed for a time, no
great harm seemed to result from its loss.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Corso Donati's death put an end to the tragedy of
which the expulsion of the Bianchi had formed the first
act; and now the condition of all Italy, as well as Florence,
was changed by a new event. This was the murder of
Albert of Hapsburg by his nephew, on the 1st of May,
1308. Therefore the election of a new king of the
Romans and future emperor was now imminent. Philip
the Beautiful aspired to win the Imperial crown, if not for
himself, at least for his brother, Charles of Valois, through
the help of Clement V. As the Pope was residing in
France, he could not directly oppose the design, but
had certainly no intention of favouring it. With the
Angevins at Naples, the Holy See transferred to Avignon,
and Rome in revolt against him, the choice of a French
emperor would have placed him entirely at Philip's mercy.
Accordingly he gave secret support to Henry of Luxembourg,
who was elected to the throne as Henry VII. on
the 27th of November, 1308. This emperor, born on
the French frontier, and educated in France, presented a
combination of Germanic and Latin characteristics. As lord
of a petty State, he had no real strength or power of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
own; but having great nobility of mind and an imagination
disposed to mysticism, he had formed a lofty idea of the
dignity and might of the universal Empire that he hoped
to restore to Rome. He seemed totally unable to comprehend
that the feudal union of Germany and Italy,
which had missed success even at the beginning of the
Middle Ages, had become totally impossible now that
feudalism itself, the principal basis of the Holy Roman
Empire, was almost annihilated in Italy. Nevertheless,
when Henry first raised the Imperial flag, enormous hopes
were conceived by the Ghibellines, and rapidly spread
throughout the peninsula. All men seemed to be suddenly
stirred to genuine enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The Ghibellines of that day were no longer the
Ghibellines of old, and in Italy the conception of the
Empire had undergone a total change. The hostile
attitude of the Popes towards republican freedom and
independence; their persistent struggle against the Roman
Commune; the fact of Clement V. being at a distance,
in France, and weakly dependent on the French monarch;
the necessity, now beginning to be generally recognised,
of building up, from the ruins of old municipalities, new
forms of government, such as were now arising in France
and elsewhere; the revival of classical studies, enabling
men to glean from the Republic and Empire of ancient
Rome some literary conception of the unity and strength
of the secular State required to meet present needs;&mdash;had
all combined to transform the mediæval idea of the
Empire. For now that France and other countries were
detached from it, the Empire was no longer universal, but
simply Germanico-Roman; while to Italian eyes it was
beginning, though still very vaguely, to seem a revival of
the old Rome that had always been the spiritual head of
the civilised world, and the possible centre of an Italian
confederated State. This idea was clearly expressed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
the first time in Dante's "Monarchia," which then served
as the manifesto of the Ghibelline party. The same idea
was afterwards more widely developed in the "Defensor
Pacis" of Marsilio da Padova, and at a subsequent date
inspired the fantastic enthusiasm of Cola di Rienzo. The
latter's attempt&mdash;so lauded by Petrarch&mdash;to create a new
Roman, Italian, Imperial Republic was a confused dream
of scholastic, classico-humanistic, feudal, and mediæval
ideas, but nevertheless a dream containing in embryo
some vague conception of the future Italian State as it
was already dimly foreseen, although with no comprehension
of its real nature. Such as it was, however, this
incoherent jumble of ideas became the standard of the
Italian Ghibellines.</p>

<p>The Guelphs had no philosophical programme of their
own to flaunt in return. The force of events, and the
pressing need of maintaining the independence of Italian
cities against Pope and emperor, was then the war-cry
of the Florentine Guelphs. To Florence, the coming of
the emperor signified the revival of the old Ghibelline
party, consequently the revival of Arezzo, Pistoia, Pisa,
and other hostile cities, all ready to compress her within
a circle of steel, and strangle her commerce. For this
reason she called on the Guelph cities, and all seeking
to preserve freedom and escape foreign tyranny, to join
in an Italian confederation, with herself at its head. It
was, therefore, at this moment that the small merchant-republic
initiated a true national policy, and became a
great power in Italy. So, in the mediæval shape of a
feudal and universal Empire, on the one hand, and in
that of a municipal confederation on the other, a gleam
of the national idea first began to appear, though still in
the far distance and veiled in clouds. Both sides fought
eagerly for the interests of the moment, and both were
inspired with the presentiment of a new future; but neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
discerned that this future was only to be attained by the
destruction of both parties alike.</p>

<p>At this juncture the Pope seemed favourable to
Henry VII., for he encouraged his project of going to
Rome to assume the Imperial crown, and urged the
Italians to accord him a good reception. Nevertheless&mdash;as
the Florentines had known from the first&mdash;he could
not wish to see Italy subject to the Empire, having too
keen a remembrance of all that the Church had endured
at the hands of Frederic II. Following, therefore, the
traditional policy of the Roman Court, he simultaneously
encouraged Robert of Naples, formerly Duke of Calabria,
who, having succeeded to the throne at the death of King
Charles II. (May 3, 1309), was naturally prepared to
resist Henry's pretensions to the utmost. At first the
Florentines appeared disposed to be passive lookers on,
but were not deceived by the Pope's pretence of encouraging
Emperor Henry. They desired a closer alliance
with Clement, but he too was very resentful with
regard to their past conduct, and with some reason,
secretly echoed the words of Benedict XI.: "Who
could imagine that those men" (the Florentines) "should
presume to be sons of the Church, while fighting against
her?" But nowise dismayed by this, they treated with
King Robert, who still allowed them to retain the services
of Captain De la Rat and his Catalan horse, and now
sent them his flag in addition. With the help of this
contingent the Florentines made repeated attacks on
Arezzo, refusing to desist even when Henry warned
them to respect that city as a fief of the Empire. Their
attacks were invariably successful, and they even forced
their way into the town, but were prevented from holding
it by the treachery of the magnates, as it was rumoured
at the <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a></span> All acts and decrees of the Commune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
bore the heading: "In honour of Holy Church and His
Majesty King Robert, and to the defeat of the German
<span class="locked">king."<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a></span></p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>In 1310 Henry set out for Italy, leaving the affairs of
Germany to his son's care. Louis of Savoy, the newly
elected Senator of Rome, was sent on in advance, and
reached Florence on the 3rd of July, accompanied by
two German prelates. The latter were admitted to the
council; but in answer to their request that Florence
should prepare to receive the emperor with due honour,
Betto Brunelleschi replied: "That the Florentines had
never lowered their horns before any lord whatsoever;"
and this somewhat indecorous response was sufficiently
indicative of the public feeling. In fact, the Imperial
envoys, though everywhere well received, obtained nothing
from Florence, and even failed to put a stop to the
war with Arezzo. And when ambassadors from nearly
every city of Italy sought audience of Henry at Lausanne,
no Florentine envoys appeared. On the contrary, Florence
was energetically preparing for defence; the new
walls were raised about sixteen feet higher, and surrounded
by moats from the Prato gate to that of San Gallo, and
thence to the <span class="locked">Arno.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a></span> On the 30th of September Robert
arrived in Florence from Avignon, where the Pope had
crowned him King of Naples, and likewise appointed
him Vicar of Romagna, to prevent Henry from seizing
that province which had recently seceded from the
Empire. King Robert soon came to an understanding
with the Florentines, and arranged measures with them
for their common defence. Notwithstanding this, Henry
continued to advance, heading all his decrees with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
phrase, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">in nomine regis pacifici</span></i>, and assuming the part of
a just and impartial judge. He summoned both Guelphs
and Ghibellines to his side, promising equal welcome to
all. He reached Susa by the 24th of October, and on
the Feast of the Epiphany (January 6, 1311) assumed
the Iron Crown in the Church of St. Ambrogio at
Milan.</p>

<p>But in this city his dream of peace was disturbed by a
sudden outburst of civil war. The Guelph Torriani were
expelled by the Visconti before his eyes; and from that
moment, being forcibly dragged into the vortex of party
strife, Henry renounced his mission as peacemaker, and
was again a German, foreign, and <i>barbarian</i> emperor.
It was averred that the Florentines had bribed Guido
della Torre to raise a rebellion, and that this was the
cause of his expulsion. We have no certainty that this
was the case, but it is an ascertained fact that they sent
money, despatches, and envoys to Cremona, Lodi, Brescia,
Pavia, and other Lombard cities, and succeeded in stirring
them to rise against <span class="locked">Henry.<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a></span> They also sent ambassadors
to Naples, France, and more particularly to
Avignon, where they lavished heavy bribes on the officials
of the Curia, for the purpose of learning when the Pope
spoke truly or falsely. On all sides they displayed such
feverish activity that one day the Cardinal da Prato exclaimed
in the presence of the French king: "How great
is the insolence of these Florentines in daring to tempt
every lord with their lousy small coin!"<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a></p>

<p>Even in crises such as these the magnates of Florence
could not lay aside their animosities, but continued to
disturb the city by fresh riots now and then. In February,
1311, the Donati murdered Betto Brunelleschi,
whom they considered responsible for Messer Corso's
death, and immediately afterwards disinterred the latter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
corpse at San Salvi, and reburied him with due pomp now
that he had been <span class="locked">avenged.<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, order was quickly restored, since there
was little leisure for private feuds, and men's minds were
absorbed in graver concerns. At the beginning of June,
1311, Florence, Pisa, Lucca, Sienna, and Volterra gave
their formal adherence to the Guelph League, and swore
to combine in armed defence against Henry. On the
26th of June, the Florentines despatched De la Rat to
Bologna with 400 Catalan horse, while the Siennese and
Lucchese forwarded another contingent to King Robert
in Romagna, where that monarch was harrying and incarcerating
all the Ghibellines and exiled Florentine
Bianchi who were then trying to stir the Papal cities to
<span class="locked">revolt.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></span> And when it was rumoured that the king was
seeking to make terms with Henry, the Florentines wrote
to him, insisting on his entering Rome at once, according
to his promise, and likewise warning him that they
would stand no half-measures, and that if he delayed, or
attempted any pact with the emperor, they would instantly
withdraw their forces from the League. "Inasmuch as
your Royal Majesty has repeatedly promised us to make
no terms with the German king, but to supply us with
an armed force and go in person to Rome to exterminate
our common <span class="locked">foe."<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a></span> This missive had some effect, for
Robert speedily despatched 400 horse to Rome under
his brother John, who, with the help of the Orsini, soon
won the chief vantage-points of the city. The king still
feigned to act in the interests of the Empire; but no one
was deceived by this pretence, and the Florentines were
satisfied.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Henry, still faithful to his original plan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>
and quite unconscious of the extraordinary change that
was going on, had reduced Cremona to submission, and
was now besieging Brescia, which opposed a more stubborn
resistance. The "peaceful" monarch vented his
rage on his prisoners and put one of the Guelph leaders
to a most atrociously cruel death. But the Brescians still
refused to surrender; the flower of the German army
was perishing from sickness and wounds, and Henry's
brother died of his hurts. During these days of slaughter,
Florence wrote to the Brescians, saying, "Remember that
the safety of all Italy and all Guelphs depends on your
resistance. The Latins must always hold the Germans
in enmity, seeing that they are opposed in act and deed,
in manners and soul; not only is it impossible to serve,
but even to hold any intercourse with that <span class="locked">race."<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></span> At
the same time they wrote to encourage other cities to
make a stand and rise to arms. They summoned the
Perugians "to shake off their bonds of vassalage, and
proclaim the sweets of liberty"; repeating to all that,
for their own part, they would unceasingly devote their
arms, men, and gold to the task of <span class="locked">resistance.<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a></span> Also, for
the greater reinforcement of the citizens and the Guelph
party, they removed the ban from all exiles, probably
well disposed to the Guelphs, only maintaining it against
several hundred supposed Ghibellines, Dante Alighieri
among the number. This modification of the Law of
Banishment was known as the Amendment of Baldo
d'Aguglione, one of the Priors by whom it was passed on
September 2, <span class="locked">1311.<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, after an heroic defence, Brescia was forced
to accept terms of surrender, whereupon Henry immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
set out towards Genoa, entering that city on
October 21, 1311. Here, though deeply grieved by the
death of his wife, he allowed no delay in the necessary
preparations for continuing his journey to Rome by the
Pisan route. And, being informed of this, the Florentines
redoubled their efforts. They strengthened the
garrison of San Miniato al Tedesco, recalled from Bologna
De la Rat and his troops, despatched reinforcements
to Lucca, Sarzana, Pietrasanta, and the fortresses in Lunigiana,
and the western <span class="locked">Valdarno.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a></span> But remarkable as it
may seem, they never neglected the interests of their
trade, even at this critical time. In fact, they chose this
moment to address the King of France, explaining the
serious difficulties in which Henry's descent had involved
them, and lamenting that the present war should have led
His Majesty to take measures hurtful to the interests of
their merchants, upon whom the prosperity of Florence
so largely depended, "<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">cum Civitas nostra ex predictis
Florentinis ex maiori parte consistat</span></i>. You have always
hitherto protected them," they said in conclusion, "and
our chief hopes are placed, after God, in your Majesty,
especially now that Henry threatens to go to Pisa and
march against us, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">qui firmavimus et parati sumus nostram
quam a vobis et a vestris recognovimus, defendere libertatem</span></i>."
They likewise besought the king to order
matters in such wise, that their trade with France might
be pursued without interruption, even during the <span class="locked">war.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the emperor had despatched another
embassy to Florence, composed of Bishop Niccolò of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
Botrintò, and Pandolfo Savelli; but when these envoys
finally reached Lastra, after encountering many mishaps
by the way, they were not only robbed, but placed in
mortal danger. The bells rang the alarm at their
approach, armed men poured into their lodging, and
the Podestà and Captain of Florence arrived barely in
time to save their lives. Accordingly, by the advice of
those functionaries, the strangers quitted the town in the
utmost <span class="locked">haste.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a></span> Thereupon (20th of November, 1311) the
emperor cited the Florentines to appear before him in
Genoa to tender apology and submission. Then, finding
that&mdash;as was to be expected&mdash;they disregarded his
summons, he placed their city under the ban of the
<span class="locked">Empire.<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a></span> Even this was received with the same indifference
as the interdicts of the Pope. But recalling their
merchants from Genoa, they hastened their preparations
for war.</p>

<p>The magnates now gave another proof of their irrepressible
turbulence. Precisely at this moment, and
heedless of the grave danger menacing the Republic, they
plunged the city in disorder with their private feuds. On
the 11th of January, 1312, Pazzino de' Pazzi, one of the
leading men, and much beloved by the people, was set
upon and killed, as he rode to the chase, by Paffiera dei
Cavalcanti, to avenge the loss of Masino de' Cavalcanti and
Betto Brunelleschi, whose murder was attributed to Pazzi.
The victim's body was carried to the Priors' Palace, and
the indignant people rising to arms, marched under their
own banner to the Cavalcanti houses, and burnt them to
the ground. As the speediest way of checking these
tumults, the Signory exiled the Cavalcanti at once, conferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
knighthood on four of the Pazzi family, and
presented them with certain lands and property in the
gift of the <span class="locked">Commune.<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a></span> Thus, even at this juncture,
order was soon re-established.</p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>During this time Henry was preparing to go to Rome.
In the Imperial camp minstrels were chanting the piteous
tale of Conradin's death, and the popular muse of the
Ghibellines continued to shower laudatory greetings on
the just judge, the celestial peacemaker. Men of letters,
poets, jurisconsults, and philosophers persisted in regarding
Henry as the new redeemer who was to restore the
Imperial crown to Rome, give Italy freedom and peace.
Cino da Pistoia cried, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nunc dimittis servum tuum,
Domine, quia viderunt oculi mei salutare tuum.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> But
Dante Alighieri was the most exultant of all, for at this
moment he was virtually the chief representative of the
Imperial party in Italy. On Henry's first approach to
the Alps he had addressed an epistle to the princes and
governments of Italy, exclaiming, "Hosanna to thee,
suffering Italy, now wilt thou be envied of all, for
'<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sponsus tuus et mundi solatium et gloria plebis tuæ,
clementissimus Henricus, Divus et Augustus et Cæsar, ad
nuptias properat.</span>' Let the oppressed rejoice, for their
redemption draweth near. Let all who have endured
injuries like unto mine forgive and grant pardon, for now
the Shepherd that cometh from God will lead us all back
to the <span class="locked">fold."<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
Afterwards, however, when Henry was about to march
on Cremona, and the Florentines had already declared
openly against him, Alighieri's joy turned to wrath, and
from the source of the Arno in the Casentino hills, he
wrote another epistle, dated 31st of March, 1311, and
addressed, "<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Scelestissimis Florentinis.</span></i> Know ye not,
God hath ordained that the human race be under the rule
of one emperor, for the defence of justice, peace, and
civilisation, inasmuch as Italy was always a prey to civil
war whenever the Empire lapsed? Do ye dare, ye alone,
to cast off the yoke of freedom and seek for new kingdoms,
even as though <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">alia sit florentina civitas, alia sit romana</span></i>?
Most foolish and insensate men, ye shall succumb perforce
to the Imperial eagle. Know ye not that true liberty
consisteth in voluntary obedience to Divine and human
laws? Yet while presuming to claim liberty, ye conspire
against all laws!"<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a></p>

<p>Then, when instead of marching forward, Henry tarried
in Lombardy, to attack the cities stirred to revolt against
him by Florence, Dante's indignation rose to its highest
pitch, and on the 16th of April of the same year he
addressed another epistle to the emperor, saying, "Men
declare that thou dost waver in thy purpose, and wouldst
turn back from it, disheartened. Art not, then, the
man expected by us all? When my hands touched thy
feet, I exultantly cried, 'Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui
abstulit peccata mundi.' Why tarriest thou? If thine
own glory move thee not, let thy son's, at least, stir thee.</p>

<p>This semi-scholastic, semi-Biblico-classical, and often
inflated language, admirably represents the ideas of the
period, and proves the excited state of Dante's mind. He
was undoubtedly the first to put clearly into words the
new Ghibelline theory that had been gradually developing
and maturing in his mind ever since he had indignantly
parted from his fellow-exiles, and turned to solitary
study. Although, as we have already remarked, this new
conception&mdash;more amply developed in Dante's "Monarchia"&mdash;was
certainly theoretical and literary rather
than practical, it was deeply rooted nevertheless in the
thought of the period, and the work devoted to its disclosure
already shows, by unmistakable signs, that the
spirit of the age was about to be transformed. In reading
the "Monarchia" we are often plunged back in the
Middle Ages, but the pale gleaming of a new dawn often
shimmers before our eyes. "The Empire represents the
law upon which human society is firmly based; it is
derived accordingly from God, the source of the Imperial,
as of the Papal power." In this we may already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
discern the conception of an independent secular society
emancipated from the Church, and thus the idea of a State
founded upon law&mdash;an idea inspired by ancient Rome, and
suggested by new practical needs&mdash;is first put into words
at the close of the Middle Ages which had denied its
possibility. But even Dante failed to see that the new
State must be intrinsically national, neither could he
perceive that the universal Empire he invoked, and now
represented by Henry VII., was precisely what made it
impossible for that State to be formed. Thus the novel
and almost prophetic portion of his book is neutralised
by its theoretic and scholastic elements. The independent
secular State, foreseen by his lofty intellect, was indeed
bound to triumph; but its victory implied the destruction
of the mediæval Empire of which his book was intended
to be the apotheosis. On the contrary, the "Monarchia"
became its epitaph, as some one has justly remarked.
Nevertheless, some vaguely distant conception of the
State, and even of the national State, occasionally flashes
forth in Dante's book, though still battling with the mists
of revived classic lore. The Empire is not, in fact, to be
separated from the Eternal City that gave it birth, and of
which it is the heir. Rome, the natural and permanent
seat of empire, was to be restored to her ancient grandeur
by the coming of the emperor. Also, were not Rome
and Italy one and the same thing? Henry VII. was the
representative, not only of law but of peace, freedom, and
civilisation, therefore by him Italy's woes would be
brought to an end, and Italy's freedom guaranteed. Was
not Henry the master of the world? Hence he could
desire nothing more, and could not fail to be the just lord
and father of all, respecting every legally acquired right
and jurisdiction. But it was precisely the emperor's
yearning to be lord of all men and all things that was
so opposed to the national spirit that was already beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
to stir many minds, and that&mdash;if almost unawares&mdash;Alighieri
was so earnestly lauding, while practically
denying it by imploring the resurrection of the Empire.</p>

<p>This contradiction gave a truly tragic hue to Dante's
mental state at the time. He was profoundly sincere,
profoundly persuaded of the truth of his ideas. Inflamed
with holy wrath against all supporters of the
Pope and the Angevins, mindful of the deeds he had
seen committed in Florence by Boniface VIII. and Charles
of Valois, he had a premonition, amounting almost to
second sight, of the numerous calamities to be wrought
upon all Italy by the obstinacy of his opponents. But he
failed to see that his own political theory would have
thrust Italy back into the feudal Middle Ages, neutralising
the work of the communes and the result of the prolonged
struggles, in which he himself had been recently involved.
The conflicting emotions stirring within him
found vent in the "Divine Comedy" depicting two
different and often contrasting worlds, and wherein the
past is touched and transformed by a new spirit, made
the source of a new future, new art, new literature and
new civilisation. In this great poem the reality of human
passion and human life breaks through the mystic clouds
of the Middle Ages, and finally disperses them for ever.
Therefore philosophers and historians may find in the poem
all the constituents of an age in which one form of society
was dying out, and another springing, almost visibly, to
life. But although the conflict of thought in Dante's
mind might produce immortal verse, it could not possibly
create any efficient political system.</p>

<p>On the latter point the advantage lay with the Florentines,
inasmuch as they always clung to actualities and the
needs of the moment. They weighed and counted their
bales of silks and woollens, and calculated the probable
damage to their import and export trade from the triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
of the Empire in Italy. They saw that it would inevitably
ruin their commerce; and by assuring victory to their
foes, <i>i.e.</i>, to the magnates, Pisans, and many petty Italian
tyrants, would overthrow their own freedom and the
government of the guilds. Was not this belief justified
by the fate of Milan, Cremona, and Brescia? This was
why the Florentines called the Guelph cities to their side,
and in the name of Italy, freedom, and their common
independence, united them all in a defensive alliance
against the foreign foe. Nevertheless they had also
leagued with King Robert and espoused the cause of
France and the Pope, whose triumph was destined to
prove fatal to Italian liberty and independence. As we
have previously shown, the nation could only be built up
on the ruins and by the destruction of both parties. The
long and difficult course of historic evolution requisite to
prepare the way for a distant future was then unknown
to all. The Florentines only thought of securing present
safety, and in this they were well advised and fortunate.</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile that "crowned victim of his own fate," as
Del Lungo calls Henry VII., continued his advance with
untroubled self-confidence. The royal peacemaker felt
no remorse at having drenched Italian cities in blood and
disseminated discord. Not even the loss of wife and
brother, the slaughter of his best soldiers, the desertion of
numerous adherents, nor the scathing contempt of his
foes availed to shake his self-assurance and certainty of
success. Calm and composed as ever, he entered Pisa on
the 6th of March, 1312, was welcomed with great pomp,
and remained amid this truly friendly population until
the 23rd of April. While at Lausanne he had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
received sixty thousand florins from the Pisans, and they
now showed the sincerity of their submission to him by
accepting new magistrates at his hands and promising a
second gift of money equal to the <span class="locked">first.<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a></span> Neither did he
feel the slightest alarm on hearing that the army of
Robert's brother, Prince John, had gained reinforcements
in Rome.</p>

<p>That prince had brought with him a force of over six
hundred Catalan and Apulian horse, and had now been
joined by two hundred of the best Florentine cavalry, led
by De la Rat, who, in addition to his Catalan troops, had
also collected one thousand foot. Fresh contingents had
poured in from Lucca, Sienna, and other towns. The
Capitol, the Castle of St. Angelo, and Trastevere, and all
the fortresses were therefore held by the prince. And as
a final stroke, the Neapolitan king, after first stating that
he occupied Rome for the Empire, now declared openly
against Henry. Nevertheless the latter continued his
march with only one thousand horse and a body of
infantry, and on the 7th of May, 1312, entered the
Eternal City. He quickly attacked and won the Capitol;
but in seeking to force his way to St. Peter's to grasp
the Imperial crown, a real battle took place in the
streets; and a <i>sortie</i> from Castle St. Angelo repulsed
him with heavy loss. Nor would his coronation have
been accomplished at all, had not the Roman people
declared in his favour and by threats of violence compelled
the prelates to disregard custom and perform the solemn
rite in the Lateran Church on the 29th of June. But
Henry was now obliged to recognise that even the Pope
was adverse, when the latter commanded him to refrain
from attacking Naples, to make a twelvemonth's truce
with the king, to leave Rome on the day of his coronation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
to renounce all rights over the Eternal City, and never
re-enter it without permission. At last the Pope had
dropped his mask, and the Florentines were proved good
prophets. But at the very moment in which their Guelph
policy triumphed, and the breach between Pope and
emperor was so plainly revealed, the people proclaimed
Rome an Imperial city and their Capitol the permanent
seat of the emperor, whose authority was to be acknowledged
as emanating from the Roman people alone.
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dum sola tribunitia, exterminatis Patribus, potestas
adolevisset illo sub magistratu ... omnia hæc parari
Cæsari, ipsum evocandum in Urbem, vehendumque
triumphaliter in Capitolium, principatum ab sola plebe
recogniturum.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a></p>

<p>Dante's own idea was now uttered by the voice of
Rome.</p>

<p>At last, and after much hesitation, Henry decided to
adopt the advice proffered by the great poet some time
before, and went to lay siege to Florence. Crossing the
Roman Campagna in August, his army was decimated by
fever, and after the capture of Montevarchi and San
Giovanni, he halted at <span class="locked">Figline.<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a></span> The Florentines, without
good commanders and with most disorderly haste, marched
a large force of infantry and 1,800 horse to the Castle of
Incisa. But they then declined to accept battle, and the
emperor continued his journey by another route, vigorously
repulsing every <i>sortie</i> made from Incisa for the
purpose of arresting his passage. On the 19th of
September he invested Florence on all sides, establishing
his headquarters at San Salvi. The citizens, having
received no news from the army, were almost taken by
surprise, but, snatching their weapons, hurried to the
walls under the banners of the people, and accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
by their bishop, sword in hand, together with all his
clergy. Two days later the troops sent to take the field
against the emperor made their way back to Florence
across country; reinforcements arrived from Lucca,
Sienna, Pistoia, Bologna, Romagna, and in short from
all the cities of the League. Thus, Villani tells us, an
army was collected of 4,000 horse and innumerable
infantry. The emperor having only a force of 800
German knights, 1,000 Italian horse, and a considerable
body of foot, was merely able to ravage the land. Fortunately
for him, the year's harvest had been so abundant
that there was no difficulty in provisioning his troops.
Even now, in spite of their great numerical superiority,
the Florentines still shrank from attempting a pitched
battle; but inside the town they felt so completely secure
that they only closed the gates facing the emperor's camp,
leaving the others open to traffic as in times of peace.
This state of things lasted to the month of November,
but then Henry's patience being altogether exhausted,
he raised the siege and set out for Poggibonsi and Pisa.
The Florentines started in pursuit, and attacked him
several times on the road, with varying results. The
emperor tarried at Poggibonsi to the 6th of March, 1313,
without provisions, or funds, and his army was so reduced
that his cavalry had dwindled to 1,000 horse. Nevertheless
he continued his march, and although, according to
Villani, his assailants were four to one, he contrived to
fight his way to Pisa, and arrived there on the 9th of
March.</p>

<p>At this time, although his health was ruined by mental
worry and bodily hardship, his purse emptied, and his
army melted away, the emperor was still calm and hopeful.
In Pisa he made many attempts to pursue the war by
legal devices: depriving the Florentines of their judicial
rights, dismissing their judges and notaries, imposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
heavy fines, and condemning many of their citizens to
confiscation and punishment. And regardless of the fact
that these sentences had no effect, he continued to launch
them as before. He prohibited the Florentines from
coining money, while permitting Ubizzo Spinola of Genoa
and the Marquis of Monferrato to fabricate within their
own territories false florins marked with the Florentine
stamp. Naturally an act so damaging to the public credit
provoked severe <span class="locked">blame.<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a></span> He condemned King Robert as
a traitor to the Empire, and made alliance with Frederic
of Sicily and the Genoese. He also determined to march
against Naples, although the Pope had threatened excommunication
on any one attacking that kingdom, which
was considered a fief of the Church. Burning with zeal
for this new enterprise, he demanded money and men
from Lombardy and Germany. He was thus enabled to
collect 2,500 foreign and 1,500 Italian horse, besides an
army of foot soldiers. Seventy galleys were equipped by
the Genoese; fifty by King Frederic. The Pisans, who
had already sacrificed everything to his cause, managed
to furnish twenty galleys. He also obtained a certain
amount of money, and set off on the 8th of August,
1313, with some reasonable hope of success. But his
sudden death at Buonconvento, on the 24th of May,
brought everything to an end.</p>

<p>On the 27th of the same month the Florentines
exultantly announced to their allies that "Jesus Christ
had procured the death of that most haughty tyrant,
Henry, entitled King of the Romans and Emperor, by
the rebel persecutors of Holy Church, to wit, your
Ghibellines and our <span class="locked">foes."<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a></span> During Henry's life they
had conferred the lordship of Florence on Robert for
five years, and now stretched the term to three more, on
the well-understood condition that their free, Guelph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
and popular government should be left intact. All they
asked from him was a military leader bearing the king's
flag, acting in his name, contributing a few sturdy men at
arms, and competent to take command of the citizen
army in order to protect the Republic from possible
attacks on the part of Pisa or Genoa, and against
Ghibelline captains such as Uguccione della Fagguiola
and others. Pisa and Uguccione were their most
dreaded foes. The latter, indeed, had already hired one
thousand of Henry's soldiers, composing the first of those
Free Companies destined to speedily become the real
scourge of <span class="locked">Italy.<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a></span></p>

<p>The Pope, now reduced to be the slave of France,
threw himself into the arms of King Robert, and named
him Senator of Rome, thus causing the return thither
of Angevin vicars. As the Pontiff hoped to be able to
assume the authority of the Empire during the interregnum,
he annulled Henry's decree against Robert, and
appointed him Imperial Vicar in Italy for a term
extending to two months after the election of the next
emperor.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Robert's augmented power and his
lordship over their city, the Florentines were now vastly
improved in strength, both morally and materially, since
they had foreseen future events far more accurately than
others, had been the chief authors of all that had occurred,
and were the friends and allies of those who had triumphed
with them. The people were substantially supreme; the
magnates were overthrown; and trade which had gone
on uninterruptedly during the war, attained more vigorous
development now that peace was restored. But what
had become of the Guelph Federation, and of the name of
Italy invoked to call it into being? All had vanished in
a flash. The very fact of the Florentines now feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
compelled to crave protection from a king, clearly proves
that their vast prosperity, notwithstanding the Republic,
had neither sufficient self-reliance nor strength to preserve
its independence unaided. This state of things
necessarily involved new complications and new dangers
which could be in no case long averted. The Italian
Commune was doomed to decay; the modern State
destined to be born; but the moment of its birth lay
beyond a period of oppression. The same fate was
already distantly impending over Florence.</p>

<p>After Henry VII. was dead, both the nature of the
Empire and its relations with Italy were changed. So,
too, the Pope's alliance with France radically transformed
the attitude of the Papal power towards the Italian communes,
for it became increasingly hostile to their freedom
and independence. The Middle Ages had come to an
end, and an entirely new epoch was now opening in the
history of Florence and of Italy in general.</p>

At the time when this sentence was written Malespini was held to
be anterior to Villani, and the latter his plagiarist. Later, the contrary
was proved by Scheffer-Boichorst, many of whose arguments admit of
no reply. But Marchese G. Capponi refused to be convinced, on the
strength of certain indications establishing, as he thought, that Malespini
had written at an earlier date than Villani. Later again the diligent
researches begun by Professor Lami confirmed the fact that Malespini's
work is a compilation, chiefly, from Villani, and perhaps, though only
here and there, from some other chronicler of possibly earlier date. The
latter hypothesis would explain the deductions of Gino Capponi.</p></div>

Everything connected with the division of the land has been the
theme of much dispute, both in Italy and abroad. It was learnedly
treated by Troya, in his work on the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Condizione dei Romani vinti dai
Longobardi</span>"; Capponi and Capei discussed it with much subtlety in
their "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Lettere sui Longobardi</span>" (appendix of the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Archivio Storico
Italiano</span>," vols. i. and ii.); so too Manzoni, Balbo, &amp;c. The question turns
on the interpretation of two passages in "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Paulus Diaconus.</span>" The passage
alluding to the first division made, when the Longobards seized one-third
of the revenues of the land, is clear enough: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">His diebus multi
nobilium Romanorum ob cupiditatem interfecti sunt. Reliqui vero per
hospites divisi, ut terciam partem suarum frugum Langobardis persolverent,
tributarii efficiuntur.</span>" But the other is much less clear, and has
been variously interpreted. This is the reading most generally
adopted: "Hujus in diebus" (<i>i.e.</i>, in Autari's reign) "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ob restaurationem
Regni, duces qui tunc erunt, omnem substantiarum suarum mediatatem
regalibus usibus tribuunt; populi tamen agravati per langobardos
hospites, partiuntur.</span>" But a tenth-century version, in the Ambrosian
Codex, runs as follows: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aggravati pro Longobardis, hospitia partiuntur.</span>"
The division of the land (<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">hospitia</span></i>), and not of the fruits of the land,
would seem more clearly indicated in this second reading, accepted
by Balbo. Prof. Capei, on the other hand, while accepting the first
reading, asserts that the word <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">partiuntur</span></i> should be interpreted in an
active sense. The conquered <i>divided</i> their lands with their conquerors,
and therefore were oppressed (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">aggravati</span></i>), being compelled to yield one-half
of their estates, but they had at least the advantage of retaining
the other half in their own possession.</p></div>

Two very short records, or rather notes, were added by another hand
where the gap occurs, namely: "Pope Adrian V., born of the Fiesco
family of Genoa, 1276, reigned as Pope thirty days; the Chair vacant
twenty-eight days. Pope Innocent VI. elected, who came from
Portugal." The second note is certainly erroneous. Innocent VI.
(Etienne d'Albert) was a Frenchman of Limousin birth, and was
raised to the Papacy in 1352. But Adrian's successor was John XXI.,
a Portuguese. The author mistook <i>Johannes</i> (probably written in an
abbreviated form) for <i>Innocentius</i>, XXI. for VI. Even in other chronicles
the two records stand together, and almost in the same words, but without
the same blunder.</p></div>

Codex Laur. Gadd. 77. On the back are these words: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cronica

of the Chronicle with Martin Polono, and why the MS. so long
escaped the researches of students of Florentine history. The work of
Professor Santini from which we have quoted being an essay sent in
for his B.A. examination, was discussed at the Istituto Superiore, and
an account given of it in the "Arch. Stor. It.," Series iv. vol. xii. No. iv.
p. 483 and fol., 1883. The paper itself has remained unpublished, as
Alvisi's discovery made its demonstrations superfluous. Santini regarded
the Chronicle as one of great importance, since it records the names of
certain consuls, omitted in all the others, but contained in newly discovered
documents, now in type, and forming part of the work that will
soon, we hope, be published by Signor Santini.</p></div>

of Æneas, he begins thus: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ex Electra Atalantis filia et Iove Dardanus

Even Brunetto Latini, in bk. i. of his "Tesoro," makes the Catiline

occurring at the battle wherein Catiline was routed, and also the subsequent
pestilence. "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">E per quella grande peste di quella grande
uccisione, fu appellata la città di Pistoia</span>" (bk. i. chap. 37, in the vulgate
of Bono Giamboni). The principal authorities for the historical information
in the "Tesoro" are Dictys of Crete, and the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">De excidio

also one of the sources of our legend. <i>Vide</i> Thor Sundy, "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Della vita

The "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Libro fiesolano</span>" styles them Africans instead of Franks, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">una

says <i>Ceto</i>, a blunder also found in the MS. that was printed. The
blunders probably originated from some ignorant copyist of the legend,
and were frequently repeated by later scribes. John of Salisbury
("Polikratikus," vi. 17, edit. Giles), in mentioning the cities built by
Brennus, according to history, repeats the same story of Siena contained
in the legend. He remarks that all this is not real history, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sed celebris

in their constitution, beauty and customs, the Siennese resemble "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad

words are also recorded by Benvenuto da Imola in his Commentary on

In digging a sewer in the street called Borgo dei Greci, in 1886,
the discovery was made in Professor Milani's presence, "at the depth
of about three metres beneath the street level, and exactly beneath the
pavement of the first circuit of the Amphitheatre, ... of a half <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">asse
onciale</span></i>, weighing 12 grammes 25, undoubtedly coeval with the construction
of the Florentine Amphitheatre. This kind of coin assuredly
dates from 89 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and was issued after the Plautian-Papirian decree
reducing the weight of the aes from 1 oz. to ½ oz. The aes cut with a
chisel were only in currency for a short time, and were withdrawn when
the new coins were issued. Accordingly they must have ceased by the
date of the second triumvirate (43 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), when the aes was further reduced
to the third of an ounce. We may therefore accept the conclusion that
the Florence Amphitheatre was of the Sullian period. Opposed to this
conclusion is the fact that, according to the report of Dione (li. 23), the
first stone amphitheatre built in Rome was that of Taurus, dating from
anno 30 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> But recalling how Cicero accused Sulla of having wasted
treasures on magnificent buildings, exactly when he was under Fiesole,
one is justified in assigning the construction of the Florence amphitheatre,
and also of that of Pompei, to Sulla's day. Likewise the basements of
the <i>Tuscanic</i> columns, found <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">in situ</span></i> near the Amphitheatre, and some
architectural fragments discovered in 1887 on the south side of Santa
Maria del Fiore, confirmed the opinion that some of the chief public
buildings of Florence were connected with the times of Sulla and also
with the last days of the Republic." (From a letter by Prof. Milani
addressed to myself.)</p></div>

Sanctorum</span>," iii. luglio, pp. 359, 379), in the two lives of St. G. Gualberto;
included in the Laurentian Cod. xx. 22, in sec. xi. The letter placed at
the end of the Codex itself is written in a different and somewhat later
hand; but, according to the opinion of Prof. Paoli, who examined it at
my request, the writing has every characteristic of the eleventh century,
"and could not possibly be of later date than the first half, or rather first
quarter of the twelfth century." It more resembles a narrative in an
epistolary form than a genuine letter. The title given it in the Codex
also supports this view: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Incipit textus miraculi quod Dominus</span>," &amp;c. We
shall have to recur to the subject later on.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, it is plain that the <i>Potestas</i> above-mentioned has no relation
with the Podestà of a later period. Here the term signifies <i>superior
authority</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, that of the Duke Goffredo. The <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Preside</span></i> I consider to
mean Goffredo's representative in Florence. Both are old-fashioned,
rhetorical terms, similar to those afterwards employed by Sanzanome.</p></div>

Murat., "Antiq.," iii., 1099. A poem attributed to Guido da Pisa
narrates the campaign of 1087 carried on by the Pisans, in alliance with
Genoa, Amalfi, and Rome, against the Saracens in Africa, and cites the
names of four Pisans:&mdash;

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">
This, however, is a poetical work, and in order to accept it as a proof
that these Consuls existed in 1087 it would be necessary to carry back to
that year, at least, the first <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">concordia</span></i> of Bishop Daiberto. This might
not be impossible, seeing that he held the bishopric from 1085 to 1092,
when he was named archbishop. <i>Vide</i> Pawinski, p. 31, note 3. Leonardo
Vernese recounts the expedition to the Balearic Isles (1113&ndash;15) in his

The chronicler designates the chief families as <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">anteriores</span></i>, possibly
because they were the first to settle in Venice; he represents them as a
supreme and governing class, and in the list he gives of them mentions
what trades they carried on. "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Cerbani de Cerbia venerunt, anteriores
fuerunt de omni artificio ingeniosi. Signati (variant: Cugnati) Tribuni
Ianni appellati sunt, anteriores fuerunt, mirabilia artificia facere sciebant
caliditate ingenii. Aberorlini ... anteriores fuerunt; non aliud operabantur
nisi negocia, sed advari et increduli.</span>" And so on regarding other
families exercising from generation to generation the same trade, commerce,
or liberal profession. As to the guilds or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ministeria</span></i>, we find
many expressions affording hints of their embryo organisation. "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hetolus
autem appellatus est, quia ipse erat princeps de his qui ministerii erant
retinendis.</span>" They were sadlers, cattle-herds, &amp;c. Many more of these
families are named in the list given in the Chronicle, and all seems to
denote the continuation of a state of things that had existed during the
lower Empire.</p></div>

This document is in the Vatican (Urb. 440), and has also been
examined by Gfrôrer. The ironsmith, Giovanni Sagornino, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">insimul cum
cunctis meis parentibus</span>," appeals first to the Doge Pietro Barbolano (1026&ndash;31),
and then to the Doge Domenico Flabiabico (1032&ndash;43), against the
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">gastaldo</span></i> of the guild, who sought to compel him to labour at iron-work
for the prisons in the palace yard, whereas Sagornino asserted his right,
according to custom, of making the iron-work at his own house, when
fulfilling his gratuitous task for the State. A regular suit was carried on;
and being decided in favour of the appellant, the latter was permitted to
do the work in his own shop. All this proves that well-defined traditional
customs prevailed before the guild possessed written statutes (sec. xiii.),
since these would have been mentioned had they existed at the time.
</p>
<p>
The document we have quoted speaks at one point of the <i>gastaldo of
the doge</i>, and at another alludes to him as the <i>gastaldo of the smiths</i>,
because the director of the guild held his nomination from the doge.
This is clearly evidenced in the thirteenth century by a decree (<i>pro-missione</i>)
of the Doge Jacopo Tiepolo, dated March 6, 1229, and by
another of the Doge Marco Morosini (June 13, 1249). Thus we see, on
the one hand, how much the organisation of the Venetian guilds differed
from that of the Florentine, while, on the other, we note how ancient and
persistent in all Italian communes was the character of their institutions
in general and of the trade guilds in particular. For the details given in
this and the preceding note we are indebted to Prof. Monticolo, a man
of great learning, and now engaged in important researches on Venetian
history, of which the results will soon be published. Meanwhile we seize
this occasion to express our thanks in print.

fantastic details concerning Prato. The destruction of Monte Orlando
is not mentioned in vol. i. of the "Annales," which only begin with the

The "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Annales florentini</span>," ii., followed by Villani, merely relate the
destruction of the castle in 1113, without any comments, for the next
event they mention relates to the year 1135. The "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Annales florentini</span>,"
i., say nothing about it in 1113, and place the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">secunda et ultima destruccio
murorum</span>" in 1114. In 1119 they record two other attacks on the
castle, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">quem marchio Rempoctus defendebat</span>": by the second of which
the Florentines "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Monte Cascioli ignem (<i>sic</i>) consumpserunt.</span>" It seems
clear that three attacks were made in succession, and farther dispute on
the point would be superfluous.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_110" id="Footnote_110" href="#FNanchor_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>
The "Annales," i. and ii., omit this event. The Neap. Codex
assigns it, as does Villani, to the year 1117, but only says that the Pisans
went to the Balearic Isles, and that "the Florentines guarded the city of
Pisa" (Hartwig, ii. 272). The same account is given by Tolomeo da
Lucca, but he dates the event in 1118; so, too, the pseudo Brunetto
Latini, who records the gift of two porphyry columns, "by reason that
the Florentines guarded their lands, while they were at the war," but
adds nothing more to this statement. As to the error of date, we will
merely remark that Capmany, in his "<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Memorias historicas sobra la
marina ... de Barcelona</span>," vol. i. p. 10, after narrating the expedition of
1113&ndash;15, goes on to say that Raimondo Berengario III. came to Pisa and
Genoa in 1118, in order to promote another campaign. Perhaps the
remembrance of this visit contributed to the mistake, the which, once
made, was repeated by many subsequent writers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_111" id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
Dr. Hartwig quotes particulars received from Dr. Wüstenfeld of a
patent dated 1114, which would seem to show that the Florentines also
took part in the expedition, in which case, he observes, the columns
might have been the gift of the Pisans, and nevertheless part of the spoil
taken in common. I caused a search to be made for the diploma in the
Pisan Archives, and obtained it through the courtesy of Prof. Lupi.
It is inserted in another patent, dated <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">vi. idus Augusti, 1233</span></i>, whereby
King James of Aragon confirms the Pisans in the privileges conferred on
them by the preceding diploma that "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Berengarius Barchinione gloriosissimus
Comes Pisanis fecit.</span>" This older patent is reproduced in the
document, and bears this date: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">M.C. quarto decimo ... septimo idus
septembris, indictione sexta.</span>" Although several other words stand
between those of decimo and septimo, this mode of writing the date
may have been another cause of the blunder committed by the chroniclers
who dated the event in 1117.
</p>
<p>
Whatever may be thought of these very disputable theories, it is
certain, on the other hand, that the privileges were conferred on the
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">populo pisano</span></i>, and that three of their Consuls were invested with them,
and received "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice aliorum Consulum tociusque pisani populi</span>," and that
this concession was made "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">coram marchionibus, comitibus, principibus
romanis, lucensibus, florentinis, senensibus, volterranis, pistoriensibus,
longobardis, sardis et corsis, aliisque innumerabilis gentibus, que in
predicto exercitu aderant.</span>" Therefore it was no mere alliance between
one or two cities: it was the Pisan people in conjunction with many
potentates from different parts of Italy. The chancellor of the Pisan
Consuls drew up the diploma, in the presence of the Archbishop of Pisa,
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">qui Dompni apostolici in predicto exercitu vicem gerebat</span>," of two <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice
comites</span></i> and nine Consuls, the names of the latter being given. This
diploma had never been published in Italy; therefore Amari, who was
much interested in the subject, wished to print, just before his decease,
the copy I had sent him, although he had ascertained that it was already
published in Spain by Moragues y Bover in the notes to a "<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Historia de

The "Annales," i., record two fires (1115 and 1117), which destroyed
the whole place; the Neap. Codex only mentions the second. Thomas
Tuscus, writing in Florence about 1279, speaks of both the fires in
his "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gesta Imperatorum et Pontificum</span>," attributing to that cause the
destruction of many chronicles which he supposes to have existed, but
which probably never existed at all. Villani adopted the same theory,
being equally unable to understand that the Commune might have had
no historians of earlier date.</p></div>

<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">de crucifixo</span></i>, and proposed this reading instead: <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">cum crucifixo</span></i> or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">de

In fact, Simone della Tosa, a later chronicler, who may have copied
from Villani at this point, after relating the second burning of the city in
1117, goes on to say that "the heresy of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Paterini</span></i> was then abroad in
Florence." Pope Innocent III. (1198&ndash;1216), in discoursing on heretics,
wrote: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Impii Manichaei qui se Catharos vel Paterenos appellant</span>"
(Ep. lib. x. ep. 54, in Migne's ed. vol. ii. p. 1147). Also, in the "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Annales
Camaldulenses</span>" (vol. iii. app. p. 396) there is a sentence pronounced at
Sutri, in 1141, running as follows: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Igitur universi qui vulgo Paterenses
vocantur, eo quia, sub iugo peccati, retinebant omnia que de predicta
ecclesia sancte Fortunate accipiebant.</span>" Therefore it is plain that the
name of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Paterini</span></i> (although strictly speaking that of a special sect, quite
separate from others) was here applied to all those occupying Church
lands, or opposed in any way to the Church. Hartwig, vol. ii. pp. 17
and 21.</p></div>

In a sentence given on December 30, 1172, we find seven Consuls
named, a judge in ordinary, and three proveditors. The Consuls instal
the judge, <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">"huic missioni in possessum auctoritatem prestans.</span>" This
document and many similar ones are in the Florence Archives, Curia
di S. Michele. Some have been printed separately by Prof. Santini, in
pt. ii. of a volume soon, we hope, to be given to the world. We call
the reader's attention to the fact that we quote from his work not only
with regard to documents which are still inedited, but also touching
those already edited by other writers, because we know that he has
carefully collated all with their originals. In his forthcoming work he
will probably indicate which documents were discovered by himself,
which simply reproduced. <i>Vide</i> Santini, pt. ii. doc. i. In October,
1181, three Consuls preside "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">super facto iustitiae, nominatim in mense
octobris.</span>" The judge <i>Restauransdampnum</i> confirms the sentence (ibid.,
doc. ii.). There are other documents to the same effect, though we also
sometimes find two Consuls for one month. On January 27, 1197, there
are two Consuls of justice for January and February (Santini, pt. ii.
doc. ix.), and so on for some time, two Consuls for two months. On
February 28, 1198, the two Consuls are judges by profession; but, nevertheless,
the assistance of a judge in ordinary&mdash;one <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Spinello Spada</span></i>&mdash;is still
required (ibid., doc. x.). This is an additional proof that the Consuls of
justice did not exactly fulfil the function of real judges. From 1201
downwards we find one Consul of justice <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">per totum annum</span></i> (ibid., docs.
xiii., xv.).</p></div>

soon afterwards (Santini, pt. ii. doc. xi.). It would seem that at Pisa
it was the rule to nominate special judges, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">electi</span></i>, or <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">dati a Consulibus et
universo populo</span></i>, who pronounced judgment on their own account, sometimes
in the presence of the Consuls. Elsewhere we find <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consules de

judgment without the intervention of the Consuls of the Commune

Originally, Florence was divided in quarters (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">quartieri</span></i>). The old
city did not then comprise the part beyond the Arno, Oltrarno, which
was only inhabited by a few "low folk of small account" (Villani, iv.
14). Afterwards, but from the earliest days of the Commune, the city was
arranged in <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">sestieri</span></i>, of which the Oltrarno formed one. In the year
1343 (Villani, xii. 18) the division in four quarters was resumed.</p></div>

It is dated January, 1165, and is to be found in the Florentine

document, part of which dates from May 16, 1209, and part from an
older period, in the Florence Archives. The Statute of the Podestà
(in 1324) also mentions the Societies of the Towers. The whole question
has been minutely studied by Prof. Santini in his learned work on
the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Società delle Torri in Firenze</span>," first published in the "Arch.
Stor. It.," Series iv. t. xx. 1887, and subsequently in a separate form. In
Appendix ii. of his previously quoted work the author includes several
documents relating to these societies. They are respectively dated

On this point I differ from Santini. The rural societies he has been
able to discover are few in number, of a different nature from the others,
and of less ancient date. Out in the country the principal basis of the
society was lacking&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the tower surrounded by houses belonging to
different members.</p></div>

Villani (v. 32) also tells us that Florence was under "the rule of
Consuls chosen from the greatest and best of the city, with a council of
the senate", that is of one hundred worthies, and that, as in Rome, all
these Consuls "guided and governed the city, holding office for one year."
He arbitrarily fixes their number at four or six, according to the division
of the city in quarters or sixths, and adds that, whenever mentioned, only
the chief Consul was named. January seems to have been the time fixed
for the election. In 1202 we find the same Consuls in the first and second
half of the year (March 1 and October 1). This would likewise prove
that the year was not then begun on the 25th of March, according to
Florentine style (Santini, doc. v.). In Sienna, January was the time of the
election, and on the evidence of the chroniclers one may infer that it was
the same in Florence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_134" id="Footnote_134" href="#FNanchor_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
The first document recording the names of consuls is dated March 19,
1138 (quoted by Hartwig, ii. 185, from the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Memorie di Lucca</span>," vol. iv. p.
173, doc. 122), and states that "<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Broccardus et Selvorus</span></i>" promise "<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro se et
pro sociis suis</span></i>." The second is dated June 4, 1138 (Santini, pt. i. doc. ii.),
and in this a Count Ugicio (or Egicio) receives "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">launechild et meritum a
Burello et Florenzito Consulibus, vice totius populi.</span>" These two documents
of the same year do not contain identical names, perhaps because
they only give those of the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consules priores</span></i>, who sat in turn, as we have
before remarked. Even in Sienna the <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consules priores</span></i> seem to have
been continually changed. <i>Vide</i> Caleffo Vecchio for June, August,
October, 1202; Caleffo dell' Assunta, 1202. And when Consuls were
replaced by Governors, each of these was <i>Prior</i> for one week.
</p>
<p>
In two Florentine documents, among the Capitoli, dated April 7, 1174,
and April 4, 1176 (Santini, pt. i. docs. vi. and ix.), all the Consuls&mdash;ten in
number&mdash;are named, possibly the Consuls of justice being omitted. But,
on the other hand, in an oath sworn by the men of Mangona to Florence
(October 28, 1184, in Santini, pt. i. doc. xv.) we read: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Annualiter
dabimus unam albergariam xij. Consulibus Florentie.</span>" Even in 1204 we
find twelve; but more than twelve are recorded in the documents of the
League (1197&ndash;8), and likewise in the year 1203. We have already given
the probable explanation of this fact. The <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consules priores</span></i>, also existing
in other communes, are seldom mentioned in Florence by the name of
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Priores</span></i>, especially in early days. But there is one doc. dated October 24,
and November 7, 1204 (S. pt. i. doc. liii.) saying: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Potestas Florentie
vel Consules eiusdem civitatis, omnes vel maior pars vel Priores aut Prior
eorum.</span>" So, too, another document dated October 15, 1200.</p></div>

There were, in fact, Consuls of the Commune, of the guilds, of the Arno,
of the city gates, of the Societies of the Towers, and the latter were more
specially styled Rectors. Yet even "Rectors" was a generic term, indicating
all who governed, and there were Rectors of the Towers, of the city,
and of the guilds. <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Potestas</span></i> then indicated the supreme authority in
general, and was only converted later on into a special and separate office.</p></div>

There are so many examples of this, that quotation is unneeded.
It was the usual formula in other cities as well as in Florence. In the
treaty drawn up between Lucca and Florence (July 24, 1184), from which
we have already quoted, there was a proviso in case there might be no
Consuls at Lucca, no <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Lucana Potestas</span></i>, and this addition was accordingly
made "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">aut bonos viros lucensis civitatis, si Consules vel Rector aut

November 13 and 14, 1197, in the Acts of the Tuscan League, we find

This document (Santini, pt. i. doc. xxii.) is that of November 13

be remarked, however, that even at this grave juncture there were more
than twelve Consuls; so, too, for similar reasons, either the number of the
councillors was augmented, or else (being towards the end of the year)
some of the newly elected members sat together with those about to
retire.</p></div>

verb <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">arringare</span></i>, to harangue, in the same way as parliament from the

often mention <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">cives salvatichi</span></i>, a term that indicates, I believe, the
quasi citizenship of persons living in the country, but bound to dwell
in the city during part of the year. These greatly increased in number

This is related by an eye witness in the Passerini collection of documents
(often quoted to us) at p. 389. The "Annales," i., manifestly err
in assigning precisely this date of 1147 to the capture of Monte Orlando,
which really happened in 1107. The erasures in the Codex just where the
date and places of the event narrated are written&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, before the entry
in Florence of Henry IV., 1111&mdash;also serve to prove that a blunder had

(iv. 37) and the pseudo Brunetto Latini give the date of 1154; the
"Annales," ii., the Neapolitan Codex, and Paolino Pieri, that of 1153.
Sanzanome, according to his frequent practice, gives no precise date
even here (at p. 130). He merely says that the first attack on the castle

expressly named) is in the Siennese Archives, Caleffo Vecchio, at c. 9, and
Caleffo dell' Assunta, at c. 53. Dr. Hartwig published a large summary
of it, made by Wüstenfeld. Thanks to the kindness of Cavaliere Lisini,
Director of the Sienna Archives, we were enabled to obtain a copy of the
treaty, and of other documents connected with the peace. Some belonging
to Florence are comprised in Santini's work, i. docs. ix., x., xi. (April

inter Consules et filios Uberti; eodem anno combusta est civitas
florentina.</span>" The Neapolitan Codex dates the first fire the 4th of August,
as Villani also does, and gives the commencement of the civil war
immediately afterwards, the which "filled two years." Paolino Pieri
dates the first fire August 4, 1174, and the fall of the bridge and the
second fire in 1178. Tolomeo da Lucca merely states that a revolution
broke out in 1177 and lasted for two years.</p></div>

We subjoin an extract from the pseudo Brunetto Latini, as it stands
in the Gaddi Codex, with all its blunders. After giving an account of the
revolution, the chronicler goes on to say: "Then in the year 1180 the
Uberti gained the victory, and Messer Uberto degli Uberti and Messer
Lamberto Lamberti were consul and rector of the city of Florence,
together with their companions, and these formed the first consulate of
the city, the which was brought about by violence, only afterwards they
began to rule the city according to reason and justice, every one preserving
his own position, so that it was decided by the citizen Consuls to
summon powerful nobles of foreign birth to fill the post of Podestà, as
will be shown to you in writing farther on." It is strange that the
chronicler should ascribe the origin of the Consuls to so late a date.
But, seeing that his list of these magistrates only begins at this point, it
would seem that he really believed them to have no earlier origin. Nevertheless,
shortly before, in writing of 1177, he had stated that the Uberti
began to make war on the Consuls; hence it is clear that even in his
opinion they had existed before the year 1180. Still, blunders and
incongruities of this sort are frequently found even in Villani and other
chroniclers of the same period.</p></div>

in naming the Consuls a hint is already given of the possible election of
a Podestà, although none had as yet been chosen in Florence. This

This diploma is given in Ficker, iv. doc. 170, p. 213. Henry (then
Henry VI., King of the Romans, afterwards, as emperor, also called
Henry V.), after granting the concession, adds: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Excepto ac salvo iure
nobilium et militum, a quibus etiam volumus ut Florentini nihil exigant.</span>"
The diploma only refers in general terms to the services rendered by the
Florentines to Henry and to his father, Frederic I. Villani considers
the grant a reward for their prowess in the Crusade; but the Crusade took
place in 1189, and the grant was made in 1187; for although he wrongly
dates the latter in 1188, this blunder does not suffice to remove the
anachronism. Besides, he also states that the concession was granted
through the intervention of Pope Gregory VIII., who was elected in
1187, and died the same year.</p></div>

Ficker often gives the names of these Imperial Podestà, as gleaned
from the depositions of witnesses. <i>Vide</i> Ficker, vol. iii. p. 440. Hartwig
(ii. 192) cites one <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Henricus comes florentinus</span></i>, also mentioned by Stumpf
and who seems to have been a Podestà of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i> in September, 1186.
After all this, it is not surprising that the Imperial authority should be
often referred to in documents of the latter half of the twelfth century.
We may cite some instances from the rolls of the Florence Archives:
October 14, 1175 (Passignano), "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Sub obligo Consulum Florentinorum vel

rather its fortress, was destroyed." In 1198, he tells how "San Genesio
was pulled down by the inhabitants" (<i>terrazzani</i>), who then returned to
the hill-top, and rebuilt San Miniato. Villani (v. 21) says that San
Miniato was destroyed, and its inhabitants came down to St. Genesio
in the plain. <i>Vide</i> also the "Annales," ii., and the Neap. Cod., <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad annum</span></i>.

document, also relating to February 5 and 17, 1198, there are the
names of ten Consuls, but three of them are not the same on both days,
so that there must have been more than twelve Consuls in February,
1198. Some, too, were already in office even in November, 1197, and
this confirms our previous hypothesis that, on the great occasion of the
League, all or part of the withdrawing Consuls remained in office with
those just elected. Nor is this a solitary instance. On April 2, 1212,

In Villani (v. 26) he is wrongly styled Count Arrigo della Tosa.
The Della Tosa family were not counts. The pseudo Brunetto Latini

As we have stated, it seems to be for this reason that the pseudo
Brunetto Latini dates the office of Podestà from this moment: "A novel

from jealousy of the Consuls, the which Potestade was Paganello Porcaro
of Lucca."</p></div>

Dated October 29, November 17, 1204, in Santini, i. doc. liii. The
oath sworn before the Consul Guido Uberto was of obedience to the
commands "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">que ... fecerint Potestas Florentie vel Consules Civitatis
vel maior pars vel priores aut prior eorum.</span>" Thus the Podestà's name
came first, even at a time when there were Consuls in office, before whom
the oath was sworn, in presence of "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Angiolerii Beati, Doratini et Burniti
Paganiti sexcalcorum Comunis Florentie.</span>" Even the office of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">sexcalcus</span></i>
is new (it is also mentioned in another document of the 30&ndash;31st of May,
in Santini, i. xlvi.), and seems to us a sign of the change tending to a
more aristocratic form of government in Florence. The communal oath
sworn on October 29, 1204 (Santini, i. doc. liv.) began thus, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hec sunt
sacramenta, quae Potestas et Consules Comunis et Consules militum,
mercatorum et Priores Artium et generale Consilium, ad sonum campane
coadunatum, fecerunt Guidoni Borgognoni comiti et filiis et Caprolensibus.</span>"
The Consuls took the oath, not the Podestà, for there was none,

Florence, and dismissed all the officers" (vi. 39). As usual, Malespini
copies from Villani (chap. cxxxvii.). But reading farther we see clearly
that the Podestà was elected as before, and that a palace was built for
his use. The chronicler's real meaning was that the form of government
was changed, and the actual governors dismissed from office. The term
Podestà was used in its general sense of magistrate-in-chief.</p></div>

chronicles and documents, in relating what was said by men of the
people as to the reforms of 1250, makes them continue their statement
that the Uberti, as leaders of the nobles, were the authors of all the misfortunes
of Florence, with the following words: "Who but the Uberti
waste our substance and our strength by exorbitant taxes and imposts?
These haughty men deemed it an honourable thing, among their other
grand and noble usages, to be our foes; inasmuch as, exulting in their
descent from the princes of Germany, they consider us to be churls and
peasants, and despise us, as though we were of a different clay from their
own." Ammirato, "Storie," bk. ii. <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad annum</span></i>.</p></div>

Machiavelli, "Storie," bk. ii. On this point it may be well to repeat
our former remarks, to the effect that Machiavelli is often as inaccurate
in his definition of facts as profound in his intuition of their character
and tendency. After the first book of his "Storie," giving a general
introduction to the Middle Ages, he begins to narrate the history of
Florence in the second book. He was the first writer, after L. Aretino,
to put aside nearly all the fabulous tales of the chroniclers touching the
origins of Florence, and start from well-authenticated facts. For although
he, too, believes that Florence was destroyed by Totila and rebuilt by
Charlemagne, and even credits the destruction of Fiesole by the Florentines
in 1010, it is easy to condone these blunders, remembering how
many other legendary tales were rejected by him, and how much time
elapsed before some germ of historic truth could be gleaned from the
less incredible traditions to which he adhered. But why did Machiavelli
pass over almost at one bound the interval between 1010 and 1215 without
saying anything of the first and second Florentine constitutions, or
alluding to the numerous deeds of war and political revolutions occurring
during that period? Regarding these events, he might have derived
information from the chroniclers. But he clings to the theory that the
Buondelmonti tragedy was the primary cause and origin of all internecine
strife in Florence, although the evidence of contemporary
chroniclers and his own historical acumen might have saved him from this
error. Continuing with the same strangely unaccountable negligence, he
skips another period&mdash;from 1215 to 1250&mdash;saying that then at last Guelphs
and Ghibellines came to an agreement, and "deemed the moment come
to establish free institutions," almost as though this were the first time
that the Florentines had contemplated organising a free government.
Yet we have seen that Florentine liberties were assured, and the first
constitution founded in 1115; that the constitution of 1250 was the third,
not the first, and established by the Guelph <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">popolani</span></i>, to the hurt of the
Ghibelline nobles, instead of being formed, as Machiavelli states, by the
united efforts of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. Nor is this the last of
his blunders, for Machiavelli goes on to say: "Likewise to remove
causes of enmity arising from judgments delivered, they [the Florentines]
decreed the establishment of two foreign judges, with the respective titles
of Captain and Podestà, authorised to administer justice to the citizens
in all cases, whether civil or criminal." In this manner he converts the
two chief political authorities into ordinary judges, places both on the
same level, and fails to remark that, although the Captain was a newly
created functionary, the Podestà had been in existence for more than
half a century. He also states that the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">carroccio</span></i> was instituted in 1250,
to give prestige, or <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">maestà</span></i>, to the army, although the Florentines had
adopted the use of the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">carroccio</span></i> long before this date. He shows equal
negligence in his account of the organisation of the army, and without
drawing any distinction between the forces of the Commune and those of
the people, although this point is fully elucidated by the chroniclers.
Villani, for instance, tells us: "Inasmuch as we have treated of the
gonfalons and banners of the people," it is fitting to make mention of
those "of the knights and the army proper" (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">guerra</span></i>). Nevertheless,
whenever Machiavelli pauses to consider the general character of Florentine
revolutions, and particularly of those subsequent to 1250, his definitions
excel those of any other writer.</p></div>

Villani, vi. 62. This incident, highly praised by Villani as a magnanimous
example, has been quoted by others as a proof that the Florentine
people must have been corrupt at a time when so exceptional a
monument could be decreed to one of the citizens simply because he had
refused to betray his country. But it should be noted, first of all, that
he was not honoured with a monument merely because he had rejected a
bribe, but, as Villani goes on to say, because "Aldobrandino died in such
excellent repute for his virtuous deeds for the good of the Commune."
Even should Villani's praises of the deed in itself seem too marked and
consequently indicative of general corruption, this corruption might be
more fitly attributed to Villani's own days than to the earlier period of
Aldobrandino and the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Primo Popolo</span></i>, when genuine virtue and true
patriotism were undoubtedly predominant.</p></div>

This result had come to pass at a much earlier period, was of
frequent occurrence in Florentine history, and was now more assured
than at any previous time. Malespini's Chronicle, chap. 104, even
before the coronation of Frederic II., refers to certain families who
"were beginning to be prominent, although too obscure to be mentioned
a short while ago.... The Mozzi, Bardi, Jacopi detti Rossi, Frescobaldi,
all these were of recent creation, inasmuch as they were still
merchants and of petty origin: likewise the Tornaquinci and Cavalcanti,
also traders, were of petty origin, and the same may be said of the
Cerchi, who shortly began to rise higher than the aforesaid."</p></div>

There are so many discrepancies among Florentine authorities
regarding this question that, after careful study and comparison of the
different accounts given by the chroniclers, we have chosen Villani as
our guide. He is the most celebrated of the old writers and the nearest
to the times described. On close consideration of his words (<i>vide</i>
Villani, lib. vii. chap. xvi.) we see that the councils are to be specified
as those of the Twelve, of the Captain and of the Podestà. But reference
to the State Archives, the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Consulte</span></i>, or first volume of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Provvisioni</span></i>&mdash;dated
a few years after the reform of which we speak&mdash;will serve to prove that
sometimes the Council of One Hundred was assembled; at others both
the special council of the Captain and his council-general and special
were summoned; sometimes again the Podestà's special council&mdash;likewise
styled the Council of Ninety&mdash;with his council-general and special,
amounting in all to 390 members (300 + 90). We also find that admittance
to these four last-mentioned councils was usually granted to the
seven masters (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">capitudini</span></i>) of the greater guilds, and that in course of
time the number of the masters increased, and that they were sometimes
summoned to meet as a separate council. By studying the number of
votes given at the councils, we find sufficient proof of the accuracy of
Villani's statements. In special councils the voting was done with black
and white balls, a record being kept of their respective numbers. But at
that period general councils only signified their verdict by standing up
or remaining seated, and the votes were not recorded in writing. But
regarding these points the rules changed as circumstances required, for
the magistrates were frequently authorised to consult <i>whichever councils
they preferred</i>.
</p>
<p>
In affairs of the highest importance, and in discussions carried on in a
strictly legal way, every measure proposed had to be first approved by
the twelve worthies, who were likewise allowed to ask the advice of confidential
private persons, afterwards denominated <i>advisers</i> (<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">richiesti</span></i>).
The proposal was next submitted to the One Hundred, then to the
Captain's two councils, and finally to those of the Podestà. All these
details are confirmed by the documents in the Archives; and as a more
easily verified instance, although of later date than the period now
described, we may quote the opening sentence of the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Statuto dell'
Esecutore di Giustizia</span>," given in the Appendix to Signor Giudici's
"<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Storia de' Municipi Italiani</span>," p. 402 (1st edition). "In the name of
God, <i>Amen</i>. In the year of His Holy Incarnation, 1306, &amp;c., firstly, in
the Council of One Hundred, and subsequently in the council and through
the special council of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Messere lo Capitano</span></i> and the masters of the twelve
greater guilds (these having already increased in number) ... and
farthermore, at once, without delay, in the council and through the
general and special council of <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Messere lo Capitano</span></i> and of the people of
Florence, and of the masters of the guilds ... done, confirmed, and
carried the vote by sitting and rising, as prescribed by the same Statutes....
Likewise after these proceedings, in the same year, same '<i>indiction</i>'
and day, in the council and by the general council of three hundred and
special council of ninety men of the Florentine Commune, with the
aforesaid guild-masters, by order of the noble gentleman, Messere Count
Gabrielli d'Agobbio of the same city and Commune of Florence, Podestà,
&amp;c." Here it should also be noted that although in this case the councils
of the Podestà assembled on the same day as those of the captain, yet
according to law and usage the former should not have been convoked
until one or two days had elapsed.</p></div>

"<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Lo Statuto di Parte Guelfa</span>," of 1335, edited by Bonaini, whose learned
commentary on the same appeared in subsequent numbers. Villani tells
us (vii. 17) that, "by mandate from the Pope and the king, the said
Guelphs <i>nominated three</i> knights as rectors of the party." But this must
be a blunder, since, according to the statutes of the party, three knights
and three men of the people were named to the office. A document
dated December 12, 1268, appended to Del Lungo's "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Una Vendetta in
Firenze</span>," mentions, "<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Unus de sex Capitaneis Partis Guelforum</span></i>." Villani,
in the same chap. xvii., confuses Pope Clement with Pope Urban, deceased
in 1264. The statute of 1335 adds a third council, of one hundred, to
the others, and this probably served the same purpose with regard to the
councils as that fulfilled by the parliament to the Republic.</p></div>

by Padre Ildefonso, vol. ix. p. 63 and fol. Still ampler details are given
by Bonaini ("<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Della Parte Guelfa in Firenze</span>") in the <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Giornale Storico
degli Archivi Toscani</span></i>, vol. iii. p. 167 and fol. <i>Vide</i> also A. Gherardi's

The Fourteen are mentioned together with the Twelve in the
cardinal's treaty of peace, and for some time later both bodies are
simultaneously mentioned in the "Consulte," according to the usual
Florentine custom of enumerating the old as well as the new magistrates.
Subsequently the Fourteen alone are recorded, and the Twelve
disappear entirely.</p></div>

Dr. Hartwig, who first called attention to this point, also remarked
that the office of <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Defensor</span></i> is first recorded in the "Consulte," in November,
1282, and that the first Defender mentioned by name is Bernardino della
Porta. "Consulte," pp. 116, 132, 133, 140, from November 6, 1282 to

of the priors occurs on June 26, 1282. Their names are recorded after
those of the Fourteen; on April 24, 1283, they are given precedence over
the latter; and from December forwards they are mentioned alone, without
the Fourteen.</p></div>

that there is no basis of comparison between the Bolognese law of 1256

different class and to two different periods of the movement set on foot

It would seem that the Guild of Por' Santa Maria originally traded
in Florentine woollen stuffs, and that the silk merchants formed a
secondary and separate branch. Gradually, however, they became
amalgamated with the guild (early in the thirteenth century), and then
became its principal components, until at last the Silk Guild and Por'
Santa Maria were entirely fused in one.</p></div>

"Again, a law was passed in 1371, inasmuch as many men traded
the shares of the Monte in this wise: One said to another: 'the shares
of the Monte are at thirty; I wish to do some business with you to-day.
This time next year I'll sell to you, or you to me, at what price shall we
say?' At thirty-one the share [of one hundred]? 'What premium do you
ask for this?' So they bargained, and the terms were fixed. When
shares fell, the merchant bought, if they rose, he sold out, and the
stock changed hands twenty times in the year. Accordingly a tax was
charged of two florins in the hundred for every transfer." Marchionne

Franco Sacchetti tells us that while he was a member of the government
the magistrates of the Republic never succeeded in enforcing the
laws against luxury. One of them, having been severely reprimanded
on this score and threatened with dismissal from office, gives the following
account of the devices by which Florentine women evaded the regulations
established by law:
</p>
<p>
"<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Signori miei</span></i>,&mdash;All my life I have sought to acquire reason; and now,
when methought I knew something, I find I know nothing; inasmuch as
when searching for forbidden ornaments, according to your orders, the
women bring forward arguments of a kind never found by me in any
law; and among others I will quote these: There comes a woman with an
embroidered trimming turned down over her hood, and the notary says,
'Give me your name, since you wear an embroidered trimming.' The
good woman takes off this trimming, which is fastened to the hood by a
pin, and, holding it in her hand, declares it is a garland. He goes to
another woman and says, 'I find you have too many buttons on the front
of your gown; you must not wear those buttons.' But she replies, 'Yes,
Messere, I can, for these are not buttons, but bosses; and if you do not
believe me, see, they have no shanks, and neither are there button-holes.'
The notary passes on to another woman wearing ermine fur, saying to
himself, 'What excuse can she allege for that? You wear ermine,' and
he begins to write her name. The woman says, 'Do not write me down,
for this is not ermine, but <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lattizzi</span></i> fur.' Says the notary, 'What are these
<i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">lattizzi</span></i>?' 'They are animals....' One of the magistrates says, 'We
are trying to fight against a wall.' And another remarks, 'It were better
to attend to affairs of more importance!'" (Novella, 137.)</p></div>

Guicciardini, "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Considerazioni sui Discorsi del Machiavelli</span>" (<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Opere
inedite</span>, vol. i., Barbéra, Florence). Full confirmation of the above
statements are to be found in this work. In treating of chap. xii. bk. i.,
where Machiavelli charges the Popes with having prevented the unity of
Italy, the author qualifies his approval of the remark by adding: "But
I feel uncertain whether it were a good or an ill chance for this province
to escape being absorbed in a kingdom; for although to be subject to a
republic might prove a glory to the name of Italy and a happiness to the
dominant city, it could only bring calamity to all other cities, seeing that,
oppressed by the latter's shadow, they were unable to rise to any greatness,
it being the wont of republics 'to give no share of the fruits of their
independence and power to any save their own citizens.... This reason
does not hold good in a monarchy wherein all subjects enjoy more
equality, and therefore we behold France and many other provinces
living contentedly under a king.'"</p></div>

To avoid the addition of too many notes to a chapter treating of the
general course of events, and only purposing to throw some light on the
political conditions of our communes, more especially of Florence, I may
say once for all, that besides the statutes, quoted in due place, the
authorities most frequently referred to are: Savigny, "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Storia del Diritto
Romano nel Medio Evo</span>"; Francesco Forti, "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Istituzioni Civili e Trattati
inediti di giurisprudenza</span>"; Gans, "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Il Diritto di Successione nella Storia
Italiana</span>," translated by A. Torchiarulo: Naples (Pedone, Lauriel, 1853);
Gide, "<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Etude sur la condition privée de la femme</span>": Paris, 1868; Schupfer,
"<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">La Famiglia Longobarda</span>," in the Law Archives of Bologna, Nos. 1, 2.
At this date it is scarcely necessary to remark that since 1868 these
studies have made enormous progress in Italy, and that many works of
signal importance have been produced which were naturally unknown to
me while engaged on these pages, only intended&mdash;at the moment&mdash;to assist
my pupils to a clearer comprehension of the Florentine revolution of
1293, and the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Ordinamenti di Giustizia</span>," which were its inevitable and
long needed results.</p></div>

Comitis Gabriellis Verri, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">De ortu et progressu iuris mediolanensis</span>,"
&amp;c. In Book I. of this work we find, among others, the following words:
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quæ omnia manifeste demonstrant, maiores nostros maximum atque
perpetuum studium, contulisse ad agnationem conservandam pro veteri
xii. tabularum iure, a Justiniano postea immutato, quo certe nihil ad
servandum augendumque familiarum splendorem ... utilius, commodius,
aptius, commendabilius potuit afferri.</span>"
</p>
<p>
Another of those old writers on law who steadfastly maintain this view
is Cardinal De Luca, who, in his "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Theatrum veritatis et iustitiæ</span>," makes
a singularly angry attack upon Justinian and all agreeing with his views
on the subject of agnation. According to De Luca, the Italians never
accepted the reforms, or, rather, as he calls them, the <i>destructions and
corruptions</i>, favoured by Justinian.
</p>
<p>
Even Giannone, in his "Storia Civile del Regno di Napoli" (bk. iii.
paragraph v.), says that Justinian's works met with no favour among us.
"They found no acceptance either in Italy or in our provinces, nor could
they be planted and strike deep roots here, as on foreign soil; on the contrary,
the ancient books of the juris-consults were retained, and the code
of Theodosius lost neither its reputation nor its authority."
</p>
<p>
Here it may be well to remark that the persistence of the Roman law
in Italy during the Middle Ages, maintained by Savigny, but combated
by others, is now admitted on all hands.</p></div>

Gans, while accepting the ideas of Savigny as to the diffusion of the
Justinian law in Italy, also takes this view, which is in accordance with
his own theory that the new forms of the Italian law were derived from
the laws of the Longobards.</p></div>

Baudi de Vesme, in his notes on the Longobard laws, repeatedly
remarks: "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Theodosiani juris vestigia hic agnoscere mihi vedetur.</span>"
Del Giudice has recently proved that certain passages are taken from
the Justinian law and others from the Theodosian code.</p></div>

This discussion may now be considered superfluous, it being
generally acknowledged at the present day, that even subsequently to
Justinian's constitution, the Theodosian code continued in force. In
this way the Justinian and pre-Justinian forms had a contemporaneous
existence, only the Pandects were longer neglected.</p></div>

According to Savigny, the school of Guarnerius was already
flourishing in 1113&ndash;18. It is now well ascertained that this school
was preceded by others adhering far less closely to Justinian forms.</p></div>

The ancient statute of Giacomo Tiepolo, of which the MS. is extant
in the Archives of the Frari, in Venice, and which has been frequently
printed, concludes its first prologue with these words: "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Et se alguna
fiada occorresse cosse che per quelli statuti non fossero ordinade, perchè
l'è de plui i facti che li statuti, s'el occorresse question stranie, et in

Aver, secondo la consuetudine approvada, oltremente, se al tuto

The <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Mezzeria</span></i> system obtains not only throughout Tuscany and

contracts most favourable to the peasantry are to be found near Florence

Two of 1250 and 1251, in the Florentine territory, have been edited
by Ruhmor (<i>vide</i> also Capei in the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Atti dei Georgofili</span>," vol. xiv. p.

by the Notary L. Ticciati, and published by him in the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Archivio Storico
Italiano</span>," Series v., vol. x., No. 4, 1892. Nevertheless, contracts on the
true <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Mezzeria</span></i> system cannot have been in general use earlier than the
commencement of the fourteenth century. A common contract drawn
up in 1331 on Siennese territory was communicated by Prof. C. Paoli
to Baron S. Sonnino, and published by the latter in 1875 Florence, in
his work "Sulla Mezzeria in Toscana." In a review, entitled "L'Agricoltura
Italiana," nineteenth year (1893), Nos. 274&ndash;5, Marquis L. Ridolfi
justly remarks that the difficulty in finding old <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Mezzeria</span></i> contracts in the
Florentine territory proceeds from the custom prevailing there of seldom
referring to a public notary for the purpose. As a rule, the parties concerned
merely exchange written copies of the agreement.</p></div>

Many historians assert that he was among the priors when the
"Ordinamenti" were compiled. But these are officially dated the 18th
of January, and Compagni states that Giano entered the Signory on the
15th of February. This statement is supported by the list of priors given
by Coppo Stefani, in his "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Delizie degli Eruditi Toscani</span>," and likewise
by documentary evidence.</p></div>

This is a <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Prolusion</span></i>, in which the learned author of the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Storia della Costituzione

Bonaini, and compares it with others. But he does not investigate the
value or intrinsic importance of the enactments, and merely gives a brief

Until this draft was published, we could only refer to posterior
compilations, and had no means of ascertaining to what extent they
differed from the law in its original form. Although Bonaini had failed to
discover the original document of the law as approved, his publication
of the first draft brings us very near to the real thing. And this is a
point of no small importance, seeing that the laws of the Florentine
Republic underwent such radical changes from one day to another, that
a compilation, dated only two or three years after the original law, might
be very different from it. For instance, Document A, published by
Bonaini ("<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Arch. Stor. It.</span>," New Series, vol. i. p. 72), contains a rider or
addendum to the Ordinamenti passed on the 9th and 10th of April, 1293.
This was inserted as part of the original law in the compilations edited
by Fineschi and Giudici.
</p>
<p>
In the following bibliographical notices I shall be obliged, for the sake
of greater clearness, to occasionally repeat or sum up previously related
facts.
</p>
<p>
1. Of the various compilations of the enactments, that included among
the printed statutes was the first to be published.
</p>
<p>
2. P.&nbsp;F. Vincenzo Fineschi published a second compilation in his
"<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Memorie storiche, che possono servire alle vite degli uomini illustri di
Santa Maria Novella</span>," &amp;c., Florence, 1790.
</p>
<p>
3. The third published compilation was given by Prof. P.&nbsp;E. Giudici
in the appendix to his "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Storia dei Municipi Italiani</span>," Florence, Poligrafia
italiana, 1853; reprinted in 3 vols., Florence, Le Monnier, 1864&ndash;66.
The Italian compilation, divided in 118 rubrics, the last of which is
mutilated, was published from a codex in the State Archives of Florence
("Statuti," No. 8). By some oversight the author chanced to omit the
three concluding rubrics.
</p>
<p>
4. The last published compilation is that brought out by Bonaini in
the "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Arch. Stor. It.</span>," New Series, vol. i, No. 1, 1855, of which we have
already spoken, and shall have to mention again farther on.
</p>
<p>
5. Another compilation, to which previous allusion has been made
(p. <a href="#Page_89">89</a>, note <a href="#Footnote_92">92</a>), is also deserving of notice. It is among the MSS. of
the Florence Archives (ch. ii., dist. i., No. 1), and is still inedited. Padre
Ildefonso published certain fragments of it, however, in vol. ix. of the
"<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Delizie degli Eruditi Toscani</span>," and Bonaini published an index of its
rubrics, 134 in number.
</p>
<p>
6. In conclusion, we may mention the Miscellany or "Zibaldone,"
likewise referred to before, which in addition to many decrees issued
between 1274 and 1465, some of which augment the force of the enactments,
also includes a petition presented by the people of Florence in
June, 1378&mdash;namely, the year in which the Revolt of the Ciompi occurred,
imploring that the Enactments of Justice should be again enforced, the
which request was granted. This codex is also a useful contribution to
the history of the enactments.
</p>
<p>
Recently both Prof. Del Lungo (<i>vide</i> "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Bullettino della Società Dantesca</span>,"
Nos. 10, 11, of July, 1892) and Sig. G. Salvemini, undergraduate
of the Instituto Superior, Florence (<i>vide</i> "Arch. Stor. It.," Series v.,
vol. x. 1892), have published the provision of July 6, 1295, introducing
several modifications and mitigations in the enactments. Although this
provision was already known to the world, by Prof. Del Lungo's previous
careful examination of it in his work on "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Dino Compagni</span>" (vol i.,
1078&ndash;80), Salvemini's clever commentary has gleaned fresh information
from it. This provision includes all the modifications made in the enactments
in 1295, and often gives fragments of the law as it previously stood,
together with the changes then introduced. Hegel, having examined all
the documents edited in his day, was the first to prove, on assured
evidence, that the rough draft edited by Bonaini, although, as he
thinks, omitting certain rubrics and comprising some disparities,
mostly of form, contained the real gist of the original enactments.
This in itself was an important result. Regarding the disparities
noted by Hegel, and the missing rubrics, Salvemini was enabled, by
studying the document of July 6, 1295, to make some novel remarks,
to which we shall refer later on.</p></div>

Rubric iii. of the draft states that "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">De prudentioribus, melioribus
et legalioribus artificibus civitatis Florentiæ, continue artem exercentibus,
dummodo non sint milites.</span>" Also farther on: <span xml:lang="la" lang="la">"Aliquis qui
continue artem non exerceat, vel aliquis miles non possit nec debeat
modo aliqui eligi, vel esse in dicto officio Prioratus.</span>" "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Arch. Stor. It.</span>,"
New Series, vol. i. pp. 44, 45. Rubric xviii., p. 66, enumerates the
persons bound to give guaranty as nobles, although exercising a trade,
"<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">non obstante quod ipsi vel aliquis eorum de dictis domibus et casatis
... sint artifices vel artem seu mercantiam exerceant.</span>"</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<i>Vide</i> on this point a document of 1287 appended to this chapter.
It proves that the practical exercise of a trade or craft was held
indispensable before 1293, and shows what precautions were required to
prevent the law from being easily evaded.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_447" id="Footnote_447" href="#FNanchor_447" class="fnanchor">447</a>
Rubric iii., G. We generally quote from Giudici's Italian compilation
as being more widely known than the others. But we are careful
to collate it with the versions of Fineschi and Bonaini, taking note of
significant divergences. The letters B.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;F. are used to indicate the
respective editions of Bonaini, Giudici, and Fineschi.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_448" id="Footnote_448" href="#FNanchor_448" class="fnanchor">448</a>
Mons. Perrens (vol. ii. p. 385, note 2) doubts this fact, and states
that it only occurred in 1305. It is certain that the Gonfalonier's function
was to enforce the enactments, and that when released from this duty by
the creation of an "Executor" in 1306, he then began to be more
specially considered as the chief of the Signory; but it is none the less
certain, that among seven magistrates, all of the same legal standing,
the one possessed from the first of loftier attributes and more direct
command of the army, was virtually, if not nominally, their president
and chief.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_449" id="Footnote_449" href="#FNanchor_449" class="fnanchor">449</a>
Rubric iv., G. and F. We should note that the Latin draft reduces
the Gonfalonier's interval of ineligibility to one year only, while the
other compilations extend it to two years, as in the case of the Priors
and as subsequently enforced. We have followed the Latin draft, for
the additional reason that, in the law of 1293, edited by Bonaini
(Doc. A. at p. 74), we find it ordained that Priors and Gonfalonier
should share the same benefits and privileges, "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">salvo et excepto quod
quæ in Ordinamento iustitie, loquente de electione Vexilliferi, continentur
circa devetum et tempus deveti ipsius Vexilliferi, et circa alia
omnia in ipso ordinamento descripta, in sua permaneant firmitate.</span>"
This is repeated even under rubric xxxi., G. and F., whence we are
forced to conclude that the prescribed interval before re-election to the
Gonfaloniership was originally different from that established with
regard to the Priorate, and only equalised with the latter at a subsequent
time. Besides, in Compilations F. and G. no thought was given to
correcting the rule laid down in rubric xxxi., where it is taken for
granted that the original diversity was still in force. Florentine laws
were always made and amended bit by bit. All doubts, however, are
solved by the document from which we have quoted, dated July 6, 1295,
extending the term of prohibition, as regarded the Gonfalonier, from one
to two years. Salvemini has found proofs in the "Provvisioni" and
"Consulte" that this rule had been already applied in December, 1294.</p></div>

Rubrics lxiii.-lxv., which, as we have noted, were added by another
hand in 1297, to the codex edited by Fineschi, and correspond with
rubrics lxxxii.-lxxxiv. of the codex edited by Giudici, there is renewed
reference to the tricks employed in order to avoid giving guarantees
or nullifying their effect. When a noble committed a crime and refused
to pay the prescribed fine, his nearest relation was legally bound
to pay it in his stead. But in this case the said relation frequently
made declaration, "that the guilty person who had either failed to give
guarantees or offered pledges unsuited to the case, possessed one or
more legitimate or natural children, aged one year, or more or less; and
that for this reason the next of kin, or those supposed to be responsible in
virtue of the said enactment, are exempt from the penalty prescribed by
the same." (Rubric lxxxii., G., lxv., F.)</p></div>

Rubric xvii., B., F., G. The two later compilations have an addition
tacked on at the end, that is not included in Compilation B. In the
Italian codex (G.) this addition is undated, but in the Fineschi compilation
is dated July 6, 1295. Its purpose is that of attenuating the law by
declaring that all omitted from the list of nobles in the statute, or who have
changed their name, and are known by another, are not to be considered
nobles. This addition was contemporaneous with the extension of the
legal number of witnesses from two to three.</p></div>

The nobles frequently employed friends or dependents to execute
their deeds of vengeance or assault&mdash;hence the enactments nearly always
refer to authors of crime in the plural as those chiefly charged with the
deed. The law of the 6th of July, 1295, was attenuated on this point,
as we shall see, by its recognition of a single leader or "captain" of the
crime, the others being only punished as accessories.</p></div>

This is derived both from the terms of the enactments and from the

partial compensation because the destruction of their property had been
carried too far.</p></div>

Rubrics vi., vii., F. and G. Not comprised in B, having been added
in 1295. It should be remarked that in the legal phraseology of the time
"common law" signified Roman law; the law as prescribed by the
statutes being held almost in the light of a special or exceptional code.
But as the enactments constituted in themselves an exception, with
regard to the statutes, the latter are referred to wherever <i>common law</i> is
mentioned. When the question was of two municipalities, one of which
was subject to the other, the subject municipality was always allowed
(excepting in political concerns) to retain its own statutes; but in cases
where these proved insufficient, it had recourse to those of the dominant
city, as though these constituted the common law.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_465" id="Footnote_465" href="#FNanchor_465" class="fnanchor">465</a>
Rubric ix., F.&nbsp;G., and vi., B. In this case two witnesses were always
needed to prove the offence, and on this point all the compilations,
including the rough draft, are agreed. Regarding the other cases,
Compilation B (rubric v.) only says <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">per testes</span></i>, meaning more than one,
that is, two or three. On the 6th of July, 1295, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">per testes</span></i> was changed to
<i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">per tres testes</span></i>, and so it stands also in rubric vi., F. and G.
</p>
<p>
It should be remarked that in the Italian compilation this rubric ix.
has a codicil that is neither comprised in the draft nor even in Fineschi's
compilation, and this is an additional proof that the Italian compilation
was of later date than the Latin text, of which it is generally the faithful
translation. The codicil decrees that the fine is to be paid to the Commune
either by the offending party himself or his nearest relation.
</p>
<p>
Rubric xi., F. and G., answering to rubric xvi., B., treats of the rights
acquired by nobles over real property appertaining to the people, and
alludes in this connection to the <i>associates</i> or <i>relatives of the popolani</i>.
This proves that the custom of joining in associations was very general
at the time, and likewise shows how nearly the ties of association
resembled ties of relationship.</p></div>

It should be noted at this point that, leaving aside other partial disparities,
those rubrics, included in Compilations G. and F., and entirely
omitted from Compilation B. (whether as the results of later decrees, or
actually passed at the time when the draft was engrossed in its definite
official shape, we have no means of really ascertaining), were those

This law, drawn up in full official form, is contained in Document A.
of the Bonaini Compilation, but still as a separate law. On the other
hand, in Compilations F. and G. we find it incorporated with the enactments
it was designed to strengthen. In Compilation G. it is dated
April 10, 1293, so also in the Latin Codex, but is undated in Compilation
G. We should remark in this connection that the law edited by Bonaini
is not only incorporated with the enactments in Compilations F. and G.,
but in both comprises codicils of a later date&mdash;such, for instance, as
giving power to call nearly the whole of the city and territory to arms, up
to the number of 12,200 men. Had this clause been passed in Giano's
time, the chroniclers could not have failed to record it. Villani states
that at first one thousand men only were enrolled&mdash;that is, the same
number authorised by the earlier enactments; the number was afterwards
raised to two thousand, as enjoined by the new law, and later still
to four thousand (viii. 1). Therefore, even according to Villani, the
number was progressively enlarged.</p></div>

Ibid. viii. 1. Compagni gives a different version in vol. i. 12.
He relates that the offenders were of the Galigai family, and that he,
being Gonfalonier at the time, had to demolish their dwellings. We
have adhered to Villani, who states the fact to have occurred under
the first Gonfalonier, Baldo Ruffoli (in office from February 15th to
April 15th), whereas Compagni held the Gonfaloniership from June 15th
to August 15, 1293, and it is scarcely probable this could have been
the first occasion on which the enactments were enforced. It is
known that Compagni's Chronicle is only extant in copies dated after
his time, and therefore probably containing blunders, alterations, and
additions made by its transcribers. Compagni's chronology is often
extremely vague. While Gonfalonier he may have undoubtedly seen
some sentences executed; but the first sentence on the nobles seems
to have been carried out as related by Villani, and also corroborated
by Coppo Stefani, bk. iii., rubric 198, Ammirato, vol. i. p. 338,
and other historians of weight. Some years after the first publication
of this essay, Professor Scheffer Boichorst produced the famous
work (<i>vide</i> "<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Historische Zeitschrift</span>," xxiv. p. 313, 1870) that raised the
very heated controversy as to the authenticity of Dino Compagni's
Chronicle. At a later period Professor Del Lungo's learned volumes
induced the German scholar to cede many of the points in dispute.
Accordingly we may still continue to refer to Dino Compagni, although
not without careful sifting and discrimination.</p></div>

meetings in which nobles and people were brought together. They may
have been private or preliminary assemblies. But even at the Councils of
the Guelph Society, as also at those of the Podestà, nobles and people sat
together, and therefore had continual opportunities for talking over

Many just observations and important notes on this subject are to
be found in L. Chiapelli's work, "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">L'Amministrazione della Giustizia in
Firenze</span>" ("<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Arch. Stor. It.</span>," Series iv., vol. xv. p. 35 and fol.); and Francesco
Novati's "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">La Giovinezza di Coluccio Salutati</span>" (Turin, Loescher, 1888,
chap. iii. p. 66 and fol.). But in my opinion both writers have devoted
all their acuteness and learning to proving the corrupt state of justice at
the time, without dwelling on the origin of that corruption and its notable
increase during the fourteenth century. Its origin should, I think, be
sought in the changed conditions of the Podestà, Captains of the People,
chancellors, notaries, judges, &amp;c. What was said of judges in the fourteenth
century, certainly could not have applied to those of the times of
Piero della Vigna, Rolandino dei Passeggieri, or of the numerous mediæval
Podestà wielding so much power, that they tried, and often with success,
to become absolute tyrants of the communes. These were not men to
act as blind tools of others' party passions; on the contrary, they strove
for their own ends alone. It may have been owing to the political decline
of the Podestà's office, and to his consequent inclination to serve party
strife, that, dating from 1290, his term of power was reduced from one
year to six months (<i>vide</i> Ammirato, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad annum</span></i>). Naturally the Captain's
term also had to be similarly shortened.</p></div>

One of the first writers refusing belief in this embassy was Professor
V. Imbriani in his already mentioned essay, "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Sulla Rubrica Dantesca
del Villani.</span>" Subsequently, my colleague and friend, the late Professor
Bartoli, applied his learning to a re-examination of Dante's entire career,
in vol. v. of his "<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Storia della Letteratura Italiana</span>," and without explicitly
denying that the embassy in question had been sent, expounded the
doubts which might be raised about it. He included in the volume an
essay by Professor Papa, who, with youthful daring, decidedly disbelieves
in the embassy. But that learned scholar, Professor Del Lungo, asserts
that it really took place. This is a very important question with reference
to Dante's career, but very unimportant as regards the general history
of Florence, since even if the embassy were really sent, it produced no
practical result. Nevertheless, without presuming to decide the lengthy
dispute, I will show my reasons for crediting the fact of the embassy.
</p>
<p>
Although Villani says nothing on the subject, it is mentioned by Dino
Compagni (ii. 25), the authenticity of whose chronicle is maintained by
Bartoli, Papa, and Del Lungo. Hence, if any of these writers intends
to deny the fact of the embassy, without denying Compagni's authenticity,
he must suppose this special passage to be an interpolation. Yet it is
impossible that such interpolation could have been made at a later date
in the fifteenth century manuscript containing the passage. Besides, the
testimony of nearly all Dante's biographers has still to be dealt with.
Leonardo Bruno (born 1369) makes very explicit mention of the embassy;
Filippo Villani, Giovanni Villani's grandson, who expounded the Divine
Comedy in 1401, by order of the government, speaks of a mission undertaken
by Dante "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad summum Pontificem, urgentibus Reipublicæ
necessitatibus.</span>" Boccaccio also alludes to it, but far more indirectly and
vaguely. Certainly the latter is no trustworthy historian, nor were the
other two contemporaries of Dante. But after acknowledging all this,
and even granting that some one of those writers may have borrowed
from the others, and likewise admitting the theory of an interpolation
inserted during the fifteenth century, in Compagni's chronicle, we are still
met by the undisputed fact, that those who studied Dante's works, and
wrote Dante's life at a period little removed from his own day, and therefore
enjoying better opportunities than we possess for learning its details,
all believed in the fact of his mission to Rome.
</p>
<p>
Until fresh documents are found, what reasons can be alleged to justify
us in denying it at this distant date? In no case, says Professor Papa,
could such an adversary as the author of the "Monarchia" have gone as
ambassador to Boniface VIII. First of all, however, the period in which
the "Monarchia" was written is still disputable and disputed. Professor
Del Lungo and many others ascribe the work to a much later period.
As far as we know, Dante was still a Guelph then, but certainly no
favourer of the Papal pretensions against which the Florentine Government
sent him to protest. Hence, so far there is nothing to make us
think his mission incredible.
</p>
<p>
But Professor Papa winds up with an argument that, as he thinks,
should finally dispose of the question. If, as asserted by Compagni and
Aretino, Dante was really sent ambassador to Rome, and departed
thence, after a time, without returning to Florence, how is it that the
decree sentencing him to banishment should set forth, as it does, that he
had been cited by the Nuncio to appear in Rome? According to the
statute, <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">forenses</span></i>, or absent persons, had to be cited by letter. Therefore,
if the citation was made through the Nuncio, it proves that Dante was
undoubtedly in Florence, and had not gone to Rome. But <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">forensis</span></i> does
not signify an absent person, <i>i.e.</i>, one who <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">extra civitatem manet</span></i>, but, on
the contrary, signifies&mdash;according to the statute&mdash;one having no domicile
either in the city, <i><span xml:lang="it" lang="it">contado</span></i>, or district.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly Dante, having a domicile in Florence, was not <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">forensis</span></i>,
and if he went to Rome was only <i>absent</i>; his embassy, decreed in
September, must have been speedily ended, since a new and adverse
government came into office the 8th of November; and Dante's banishment
was only proclaimed on the 27th of January of the following year.
Together with three other persons he was cited to appear and be heard
in his own defence and exculpation. As neither he nor the others
appeared, and none of them would have consented to appear, even if in
Florence, they were condemned, as they would have been in any case.
Thus, strictly speaking, it cannot be said that even in this instance there
was any violation of legal procedure, although in those days legality,
justice, and humanity were trampled under foot without the slightest
scruple.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, as Professor Bartoli admits, there is no absolute proof of
the impossibility of the embassy in question. Even if Villani's silence
may seem strange, Compagni's statement to be considered an interpolation,
the fact remains that the embassy was credited at a time little
removed from Dante's day, and credited by men better acquainted than
we can be with the circumstances of his career. For these reasons,
while admitting the weight of often reiterated doubts, pending absolute
proof to the contrary, I shall retain my belief in the embassy.</p></div>

An anonymous and undated epistle addressed to Cardinal Da Prato
by the Captain Alessandro (supposed to be Alessandro da Romena) and
the council and university of the Bianchi party, was published among
Dante's Letters as one composed by him for the use of his fellow-exiles,
and was long attributed to him by his biographers. But the Captain's
name is not given in the old manuscript from which the letter was
printed, but merely indicated thus: <i>A. ca.</i> (Epistle I. of the Fraticelli
edition, Florence, Barbèra, 1863).
</p>
<p>
This epistle says in reply to letters and advice from the Cardinal that
the Bianchi are grateful to him and disposed to peace. "<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ad quid aliud
in civile bellum corruimus? Quid aliud candida nostra signa petebant?
Et ad quid aliud enses et tela nostra rubebant, nisi ut qui civilia iura,
temeraria voluptate truncaverunt, et iugo piæ legis colla submitterent, et
ad pacem patriæ cogerentur?</span>" Therefore the gist of Dante's words
would have been: The desire to have our laws and liberties respected
was the sole cause of our rebellion; all that we now wish is to see
justice and peace again triumphant. This language is worthy of the
poet, we think.
</p>
<p>
But doubts have lately arisen as to his authorship. Professor Bartoli,
after examining the subject from all points, and ingeniously discussing
all different theories respecting it, concludes his prolonged and careful
inquiry by stating that there is no historical evidence to prove whether
the letter were really by Dante or not ("<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Storia della Letteratura
Italiana,</span>" vol. v. chaps. 8&ndash;10). Professor Del Lungo says that the
style of the letter is Dantesque, in its merits as well as in certain
defects; but that this fact does not justify him in decidedly attributing
it to the poet's pen, since it may have proceeded from some contemporary
in similar circumstances. Indeed, after examining the contents
of the letter, he considers that it cannot have been written by Dante,
and, among other reasons, chiefly because the words <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">candida nostra
signa</span></i>, and <i><span xml:lang="la" lang="la">enses et tela nostra rubebant</span></i>, &amp;c., are almost identical with
those used by Compagni in describing the fight that occurred at Lastra
on the 20th of July, 1304. Hence, he is of opinion that the letter undoubtedly
refers to that event, and was therefore only written after
that date. And seeing that Dante had separated from the exiles
before that time, Del Lungo considers that the letter cannot be by
him.
</p>
<p>
For my own part, I doubt whether the letter really referred to the
Lastra affair. Surely the words in question: "Our white ensigns
were displayed, and our weapons flashed," may have been used either
in reference to Lastra or any other battle fought by the exiles, in
spite of their resemblance to, and apparent translation from the
passage in Compagni relative to the fight at Lastra. This being the
case, without altogether rejecting Del Lungo's view, I will merely
remark that his argument is insufficient to disprove Dante's authorship,
since the poet may have written the letter in the name of the
exiles, when they were carrying on those negotiations with the Cardinal
on the subject of peace, afterwards leading, as we have seen, to the
despatch of twelve delegates to Florence. The failure of those negotiations,
the cruel slaughter of the Cavalcanti and their friends, the
wholesale destruction by fire and pillage, the partial junction of the
Bianchi with Corso Donati, and the union of the exiles with the
Bolognese, Pistoiese, Pisans, and all foes of Florence, immediately
followed up by the foolish attempt at Lastra, may well suffice to explain,
not only Dante's indignant withdrawal from the exiled Bianchi, but
likewise the withdrawal of many other citizens. In fact, the latter's
non-appearance at Lastra may be perhaps assigned to the same motive,
as we shall have occasion to show later on.</p></div>

Prof. Del Lungo, the editor of these documents, does not believe that
Corso was favourable at that time to the exiles and Ghibellines. Besides,
the latter were no longer the genuine Ghibellines of older days. Therefore
the Signory could have no motive for deceiving their friends, the
Lucchese, and their letters are likewise corroborated by the previous
events we have described.</p></div>

<p>Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected, often
after referencing other printings or editions of this book.</p>

<p>Occasional unpaired
quotation marks have been retained unless the position of the missing
one was obvious.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>Extraneous commas were retained.</p>

<p>Illustrations have been moved closer to the relevant text.</p>

<p>Text uses both "Bölognese" and "Bolognese", "Bölogna" and "Bologna".</p>

<p>Chapter IX does not have a section VII. This appears to be a misprint,
not missing text.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been collected and repositioned just before the Index.</p>

<p>Page references in the Index were not checked for accuracy.</p>
